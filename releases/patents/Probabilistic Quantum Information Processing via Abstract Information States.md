# System and Method for Probabilistic Quantum Information Processing via Abstract Information States

## **Cross-Reference To Related Applications**

**[0001]** This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/751,887, filed on January 31, 2025, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

## **Background Of the Invention**

**[0002]** **Field of the Invention:** This invention relates to quantum information theory and analog quantum computing, specifically systems for encoding, processing, and preserving probabilistic quantum information states.

**[0003]** **Description of Prior Art:** Traditional quantum computing frameworks treat qubits as physical particles (e.g., trapped ions, superconducting circuits), leading to challenges in coherence and scalability. Gate-based architectures force inherently probabilistic quantum states into discrete (0/1) outcomes, while measurement-induced collapse limits computational utility. Emerging approaches (e.g., topological qubits) remain tied to physical implementations and fail to address the fundamental mismatch between quantum mechanics and classical computation.

**[0004]** **Theoretical Basis:** The invention builds on physicist John Wheeler’s “it from bit” hypothesis that information is the foundational substrate of physical reality. Prior work in quantum information theory (Nielsen & Chuang, 2000) and bio-inspired quantum models (Hameroff & Penrose, 2014) further supports this framework.

## **Summary Of the Invention**

**[0005]** The invention provides a platform for **probabilistic quantum information processing** by reframing quantum systems as manifestations of abstract information states. Key innovations include:
- **Abstract Information Units:** Non-physical representations of quantum states as continuous probabilistic distributions.
- **Collapse-Resistant Processing:** Analog controls and non-demolition measurements preserve superposition.
- **Bio-Inspired Preservation:** Optional embodiments leverage biological principles (e.g., microtubule dynamics) to enhance coherence.

**[0006] Advantages Over Prior Art:**
- Natural alignment with quantum mechanics’ probabilistic nature.
- Scalability via decoupling from fragile physical qubits.
- Novel integration of information theory and quantum computing.

## **Detailed Description**

### **Core Information-Theoretic Framework**

**[0007]** The system comprises:
- **Abstract Information Units:** Configurable to represent quantum states as continuous probabilistic distributions (e.g., geometric superpositions in lattice structures).
- **Functional Equivalents:** Implementations include microtubule-inspired lattices, photonic arrays, or superconducting qubits (Fig. 1A-1C, *not shown*).

**[0008]** **Enablement:** The invention is enabled by principles from quantum information theory (e.g., continuous-variable systems) and experimental work in bio-inspired quantum coherence. For example:
- **Microtubule Lattices:** Tubulin subunit arrangements (13-protofilament topology) enable geometric superpositions.
- **Dielectric Shielding:** High-permittivity materials (ε > 50, e.g., SrTiO₃) suppress decoherence.

### **Probabilistic Processing Mechanisms**

**[0009]** Processing means include:
- **Analog Controls:** Electromagnetic fields or acoustic waves modulate lattice parameters to steer state evolution.
- **Non-Demolition Measurements:** Interferometric detectors reconstruct probabilistic distributions via inverse Fourier transforms (Fig. 2A, *not shown*).

### **Coherence Preservation**

**[0010]** Preservation means leverage:
- **Topological Protection:** Non-local encoding resists environmental noise.
- **Dynamic Reconfiguration:** Real-time adjustments to lattice geometry (e.g., helical pitch, node spacing).

### **Exemplary Embodiments**

**[0011]** Non-limiting implementations include:
- **Microtubule-Inspired System:** Tubulin lattice with aqueous dielectric shielding (mimicking intracellular environments).
- **Superconducting Network:** Josephson junctions encoding states via phase/amplitude oscillations.

## **Claims**

1. **A system for processing probabilistic quantum information, comprising:**
   an information-theoretic framework configured to represent quantum states as abstract, non-physical information units, wherein said units encode continuous probabilistic distributions.

2. **The system of claim 1, further comprising:**

3. **The system of claim 1, further comprising:**
