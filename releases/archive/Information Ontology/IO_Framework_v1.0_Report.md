revision_notes: |
  v1.0 (Final) (2025-04-16): Added outcome of Sprint 24 (failure to derive alpha). Concluded that the accumulation of analytical difficulties and lack of compelling evidence for the dynamics (Eq. IO-2') supporting necessary solutions, despite the conceptual appeal of EQR, necessitates falsifying this specific implementation. Decision made to reset and explore alternatives in v2.0.
  v1.0 (Initial) (2025-04-16): Consolidated report focusing on the final EQR framework emerging from the v0.1-v1.0 exploration. Summarized background, failed paths (briefly), the EQR breakthrough, its implications, and the critical next steps/roadmap. Detailed process moved to Appendix_A_IO_v0.1-v1.0_ProcessLog.md.

# Information Ontology (IO) Framework v1.0: Emergent Quantization from Resolution

## 1. Introduction & Motivation
*(Unchanged - See previous version)*

## 2. Initial Attempts & Falsification (v0.1-v0.5 Summary)
*(Unchanged - See previous version)*

## 3. Breakthrough: Emergent Quantization from Resolution (EQR) (v1.0 Core)
*(Unchanged - See previous version - EQR concept remains compelling)*

## 4. Current Status & Critical Dependence (Focus on Eq. IO-2')
*(Unchanged - See previous version - Still identifies Eq. IO-2' as candidate dynamics and highlights dependence on solutions)*

## 5. Final Assessment & Falsification (End of v1.0)

While the EQR hypothesis developed in Phase v1.0 (Sprints 7-13) provided compelling conceptual solutions to quantization, measurement, EM coupling, entanglement, and gravity links, its viability depended critically on the underlying continuous dynamics (tentatively Eq. IO-2') supporting the necessary stable, non-perturbative solutions ($\mathbf{\Psi}_{sol}$).

Subsequent analysis revealed significant problems with relying on Eq. IO-2':
*   **Analytical Intractability:** Attempts to find exact analytical solutions failed (Sprint 20).
*   **Lack of Predictive Power:** The framework failed to provide any mechanism to derive or constrain fundamental constants like the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ (Sprint 24).
*   **Reliance on Unproven Solutions:** The *only* positive evidence for stable solutions came from preliminary, limited 1+1D simulations (Sprint 18/19), while the core requirement is robust 3+1D solutions. The conceptual arguments for S=1/2 spinor behavior remained weak (Sprint 6).

**Conclusion:** The accumulation of analytical difficulties, the lack of predictive power regarding fundamental constants, and the continued reliance on unproven (and potentially non-existent) solutions for the specific dynamics of Eq. IO-2' outweigh the conceptual elegance of the EQR model *as implemented in v1.0*. The burden of proof required to justify proceeding with computationally expensive simulations of Eq. IO-2' has not been met.

**Decision:** **FALSIFY the IO/EQR framework v1.0 implementation based on Eq. IO-2'.** While the core IO axioms and the EQR *concept* may hold value, this specific mathematical realization is deemed insufficient and unlikely to succeed.

## 6. Next Steps: Framework Reset (v2.0)

A fundamental reset is required. Future work (Phase v2.0) must explore alternative mathematical implementations of the IO axioms, incorporating lessons learned:
*   The EQR concept (quantization via interaction/resolution) should be considered for retention.
*   Alternative continuous dynamics are needed that demonstrably support stable, massive, localized solutions (S=0 and S=1/2) and allow consistent EM coupling.
*   Alternative mathematical structures beyond $\mathcal{G}(1,3)$ with Eq. IO-2' should be evaluated.
