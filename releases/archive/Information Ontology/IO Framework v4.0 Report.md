  v4.0 (2025-04-17): Initiated IO v4.0 framework based on fundamentally Non-Local Relational Network dynamics combined with EQR. This represents a major pivot after falsification of previous local continuum and rule-based approaches (v0.x-v3.0). Defined core structure (non-local edges), outlined plausible mechanisms for emergent locality/dimensionality, and successfully modeled entanglement manifestation conceptually (Sprint 57). Established initial conceptual viability. Next steps focus on simulating emergent locality/dimensionality. Governed by OMF v1.7 ([[Appendix B OMF]]). Added self-filename alias.

# Information Ontology (IO) Framework v4.0: Non-Local Network & EQR

## 1. Introduction: A New Foundation (IO v4.0)

The Information Ontology (IO) project seeks a fundamental theory of physics grounded in information principles, addressing deep challenges in standard models (QM/GR incompatibility, measurement problem, dark sector, origin of constants) as outlined in critiques like the "Mathematical Tricks Postulate" ([[Mathematical Tricks Postulate]]). Previous iterations (v0.x-v3.0), exploring implementations based on Geometric Algebra (GA), Non-Linear Dirac Equation (NLDE) dynamics, and local Rule-Based systems (hypergraphs) coupled with Emergent Quantization from Resolution (EQR), were rigorously developed but ultimately **falsified** or reached impasses due to failure to demonstrably generate required stable emergent structures or incorporate known physics consistently. (Detailed history and falsification rationale in [[Appendix C Process Log]]).

This **v4.0** marks a **fundamental shift** based on lessons learned, particularly the failure of local models to naturally account for quantum entanglement. IO v4.0 retains the core IO logical foundation (I/O Process / Relational Manifestation Ontology) and the powerful EQR concept, but implements them on a radically different substrate: a **Fundamentally Non-Local Relational Network**.

**Core Idea:** Reality's substrate (I) is an evolving network of abstract nodes and relations (edges). Crucially, **direct non-local edges** are permitted, representing fundamental correlations like entanglement. Spacetime and locality are **emergent, effective properties** arising from the network's large-scale structure and dynamics. Quantum phenomena manifest via **EQR interactions** operating locally but accessing information through both local and non-local network connections.

This report summarizes the conceptual foundation of IO v4.0 established in the initial exploratory sprints (Sprints 55-57, documented in [[Appendix C Process Log]]).

## 2. IO v4.0 Logical Foundation & OMF

The framework adheres to the **I/O Process / Relational Manifestation Ontology** (L1-L5) and is governed by the **Operational Meta-Framework (OMF) v1.7** ([[Appendix B OMF]]), which mandates emergence, calibration via structure, comparative testing, falsification, parsimony, acknowledgment of incompleteness, and rigorous documentation. The interpretation of L4 (Substrate) is now explicitly the non-local relational network.

## 3. Non-Local Network Structure & Dynamics

*   **Structure:** Abstract nodes $N$ connected by potentially multiple **typed edges** $E$ (e.g., $e^{(local)}, e^{(entangle)}$) carrying state information $S_{AB}^{(type)}$. The network is not embedded in *a priori* spacetime. (Sprint 55).
*   **Non-Locality:** Fundamental non-local edges ($e^{(entangle)}$) directly represent quantum correlations, existing independently of emergent spatial distance. (Sprint 55).
*   **Dynamics:** Governed by **local rules** (acting on nodes and their direct neighbors via edges, even non-local ones) that evolve the network structure ($N_\tau, E_\tau$) and states ($S_{AB}^{(type)}$). Specific rules are yet to be determined but must be compatible with emergent properties. (Sprint 55).

## 4. Emergent Locality & Spacetime

A critical requirement is reconciling fundamental non-locality with observed macroscopic locality and D≈3+1 spacetime (OMF Calibration Criterion 4a). Plausible mechanisms identified (Sprint 56):
*   **Activity-Based Rewiring:** Dynamically strengthening frequently used local pathways while persistent non-local edges remain less influential for most interactions. Dimensionality depends on specific attachment/pruning rules.
*   **Causal Network Dominance:** A primary network of causal links enforces locality for standard propagation/manifestation (potentially yielding D≈3+1 via CDT-like rules), with non-local edges acting as acausal shortcuts for entanglement correlations.
*   **Conclusion:** Effective locality and dimensionality can plausibly emerge dynamically from the non-local network, allowing fundamental non-locality (for QM) and effective locality (for classical physics/spacetime) to coexist.

## 5. EQR Integration & Entanglement Explanation

*   **EQR on Network:** EQR manifestation events occur via interactions at nodes, accessing state information through connected edges (local and non-local), limited by resolution ε. (Sprint 55).
*   **Entanglement Solved Conceptually:** Local EQR measurements at nodes $n_A$ and $n_B$, connected by a non-local edge $e_{AB}^{(entangle)}$ encoding correlation state $S_{AB}$ (e.g., singlet), naturally reproduce QM Bell correlations ($-\cos(\theta_{ab})$). The correlation arises because both local measurements access the shared non-local information constraint via the edge $e_{AB}$. The EQR probability rule ($P_n \propto I_n$) applied locally yields outcomes consistent with this constraint, violating Bell inequalities without requiring FTL signaling or wavefunction collapse. (Sprint 57 - Compelling Finding).

## 6. Current Status & Roadmap (Start of IO v4.0 Development)

IO v4.0 (Non-Local Network + EQR) provides a novel, conceptually coherent foundation that directly incorporates non-locality and successfully explains entanglement manifestation via EQR. It overcomes major hurdles of previous IO versions.

**Critical Path & Next Steps:**

1.  **Computational Validation of Emergent Locality/Dimension (Sprint 58 Next):** Perform simulations (potentially simplified/executable first) to demonstrate that specific network evolution rules (e.g., combining causal structure and activity-based rewiring) robustly generate D≈3+1 effective geometry and locality. **(Highest Priority - Addresses Calibration 4a)**.
2.  **Computational Validation of Emergent Stable Particles:** Demonstrate that the same rules support the emergence of diverse, stable, localized topological/relational patterns (proto-particles) within the emergent spacetime. **(Addresses Calibration 4b)**.
3.  **Formalize EQR on Network:** Develop the mathematical details of EQR operating on network states, deriving quantization and probabilities rigorously. **(Addresses Calibration 4e)**.
4.  **Derive Physics:** Connect emergent structures/interactions to SM/GR, derive constants, make predictions. **(Addresses Calibration 4c, 4d, 4f)**.

## 7. Conclusion

IO v4.0 represents a promising new direction for the Information Ontology project, shifting the foundation to non-local relations while retaining the powerful EQR mechanism. Its ability to naturally explain entanglement conceptually is a significant advance. The immediate focus must be on computational and theoretical validation of emergent spacetime, particle structures, and the EQR formalism within this new non-local network context, adhering strictly to the OMF v1.7.
