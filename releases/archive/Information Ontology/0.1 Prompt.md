**Seed Prompt: Information Ontology (IO) - Foundational Exploration v0.1**

**Subject: Deriving Stable Structures from a Continuous Informational Medium**

**1. Premise & Motivation:**

Standard physical theories face foundational challenges (QM/GR incompatibility, measurement problem, unexplained parameters, dark sector, singularities, critique of quantization). This inquiry explores an alternative framework, **Information Ontology (IO)**, based on minimalist principles:

*   **Axiom IO-1: Fundamental Informational Medium:** Reality originates from a fundamental, **continuous medium** (denoted $\mathcal{F}$), representing potentiality for structure and relation, prior to discrete particles or spacetime geometry.
*   **Axiom IO-2: Intrinsic Dynamics:** The behavior of $\mathcal{F}$ is governed solely by **intrinsic dynamic principles** inherent to the medium itself (e.g., propagation speed $c_0$, self-interaction parameters $\mu, \lambda$). These dynamics must allow for cyclical and structuring behavior. **No *a priori* governance by specific constants like π or φ is assumed.**
*   **Axiom IO-3: Emergent Localized Structures:** Observable entities ("particles") are **stable, localized, resonant patterns** emerging dynamically within $\mathcal{F}$ as solutions to its intrinsic dynamics. Stability arises from the dynamics themselves (e.g., energy minima, attractors).
*   **Axiom IO-4: Manifestation via Interaction/Resolution:** Patterns become manifest through **interaction processes** characterized by a **Resolution (ε)**, which determines the observable properties contextually.

**2. Rejection of A Priori Assumptions:**

This exploration explicitly **rejects**: *a priori* quantization (ħ), specific roles for π/φ via exponents/indices, targeting SM particle properties, complex pre-existing geometries (E8), Lagrangians for fundamental dynamics.

**3. Initial Task: Exploring the Simplest Model**

Start with the simplest mathematical representation:
*   **Field:** Real scalar field $\psi(x, t)$.
*   **Dynamics:** Simplest non-linear wave equation supporting structure:
    **(Eq. IO-1):** $(\frac{1}{c_0^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2) \psi + V'(\psi) = 0$, with $V(\psi) = \frac{\mu^2}{2} \psi^2 + \frac{\lambda}{4} \psi^4$. Parameters: $c_0, \mu^2, \lambda$. Assume $\mu^2<0, \lambda>0$ for SSB.
*   **Objective:** Investigate stable, localized solutions (oscillons) in 3+1D. What are their properties (Energy M, Spin S=0, Charge Q=0)? Can this minimal model form the basis, or is immediate complexity (e.g., complex scalar, GA field) required to match basic observations like Spin S=1/2? Apply **Assumption Sensitivity Testing** ([[L Assumption Sensitivity Testing]]) and **Fail Fast** principles.

**4. Methodology:** Prioritize internal consistency and qualitative structure ("Theory First"). Use the **Integrated Turn Process** ([[N Collaborative Research Process]]). Document failures ([[M Methodological Failure Analysis]]).
