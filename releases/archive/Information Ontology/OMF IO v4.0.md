# Operational Meta-Framework (OMF) for Information Ontology (IO) v4.0

## 1. Preamble
*(Content remains as in previous v1.7 draft)*
This document defines the Operational Meta-Framework (OMF)... established based on the core IO logical foundation (L1-L5, Non-Local Network)... incorporates lessons learned... Adherence to this OMF is mandatory... parking broader philosophical questions for separate consideration (`[[Appendix D ParkingLot Musings]]`).

## 2. Core Logical Foundation (IO v4.0 Recap - Non-Local Network)
*(Content remains as in previous v1.7 draft)*
Development proceeds from the I/O Process / Relational Manifestation Ontology, implemented via a Fundamentally Non-Local Relational Network:
*   **L1: Potential for Observation/Interaction:** ...
*   **L2: Manifestation via Interaction & Contrast (κ, ε):** ...
*   **L3: Existence as Stable Manifested Contrast (Î):** ...
*   **L4: Relational Network as Substrate (I):** ...
*   **L5: Rules of Network Evolution & Manifestation (EQR):** ...

## 3. Operational Meta-Framework Rules
*(Content of Rules 1-11 remains as in previous v1.7 draft)*

1.  **Primacy of Logic & Ontology...**
2.  **Focus on Emergence...**
3.  **Interaction/Resolution (EQR) is Central...**
4.  **Calibration via Emergent Structure & Universality (Revised for v4.0):**
    *   **Rule:** Validation... must prioritize... emergence of fundamental, qualitative structural features... from the **non-local network dynamics**.
    *   **Accountability:** Success requires demonstrating emergence of: (a) **Effective Spacetime Structure** (effective 3+1D, approx. Lorentz, effective locality)... (b) Stable Structures... (c) Conservation Laws... (d) Interaction Types... (e) Quantum Nature (EQR features)... (f) Universality Classes... *Failure constitutes falsification.* ...
5.  **Mandatory Comparative Testing, Falsification & Pivoting...**
6.  **Parsimony and Justification...**
7.  **Bootstrapping & Self-Compliance...**
8.  **Distinction Between Conceptual Analysis and Simulation Validation...**
9.  **Complete & Explicit Documentation...**
10. **Acknowledgment of Incompleteness & Process Focus...** (See `[[Appendix D ParkingLot Musings]]` for related philosophical considerations).
11. **Persistent Adversarial Critique & Comparative Evaluation...**

## 4. Documentation and Style Conventions
*(Content remains as in previous v1.7 draft - Link to Style Guides)*
All documentation produced within the IO project must adhere to established conventions (`[[Style Guide for Document Formatting]]`, `[[releases/archive/Infomatics/v3.4/G Style Notation]] or successor).
*(Subsections 4.1-4.8 detailing Format, Prose, Terminology, Tone, Citations, Formatting, Metadata, Notation remain as in v1.5)*

## 5. Application
*(Content remains as in previous v1.7 draft)*
This Operational Meta-Framework (OMF) version 1.7 governs all subsequent development within the IO v4.0 framework (Non-Local Network + EQR) and any potential future iterations...
