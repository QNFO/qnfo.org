  v EFD-1.1 (Final) (2025-04-18): Added EFD (EQR Formalism Development) phase (Sprints EFD-1.1.1 to EFD-1.1.27). Focused on translating EQR v1.0 into RQFT. Addressed states, interactions, covariant update (via hypersurfaces), covariant basis selection (via decoherence), role of j0=hbar conceptually. Attempted formal Born rule derivation via envariance: setup formalized, logic tested on toy models, but rigorous derivation in RQFT failed due to inability to formally construct required envariance swap operators (EFD-1.1.27). Documented decision to conclude EFD phase and the overall IO/EQR exploration line due to this formal validation barrier. Regenerated full log text.
  v4.2 (2025-04-18): Added IO v4.2 phase (Sprints 66-76). Explored Iteration Dynamics + Koopman Operators as a potential EQR substrate. Developed conceptual model. Designed and attempted execution of toy model validation. Encountered analytical/computational barrier for required Koopman analysis. Concluded IO v4.2 phase.
  v4.1 (2025-04-18): Added Sprints 58-65 covering the IO v4.1 phase: Evaluation of future directions, selection of EQR as standalone theory, definition of EQR v1.0 framework, analysis, refinement, critical assessment, and consolidation into EQR v1.0 Framework Report. Concluded IO v4.1 phase.
  v4.0 (2025-04-17): Consolidated log up to IO v4.0 Kickoff (Sprints 1-57). Covered initial explorations, GA, NLDE, Rule-Based Systems, Non-Local Networks. Documented termination of IO v4.0.

# Appendix C: Information Ontology (IO) / EQR Process Log (v0.1 - EFD Conclusion)

This appendix documents the detailed analysis steps, hypotheses tested, intermediate findings, key decisions, and falsifications during the development of the Information Ontology (IO) framework (v0.1-v4.2) and the subsequent EQR Formalism Development (EFD) phase. Development was governed by the Operational Meta-Framework (`[[Appendix B OMF]]`). Broader philosophical points are in `[[Appendix D Parking Lot Musings]]`.

*(Note: Sprints are renumbered sequentially within phases for clarity.)*

## Phases v0.1 - v4.2: Substrate Exploration & Standalone EQR (Sprints 1-78)

*(Summarized - See previous versions for details)*
These phases involved exploring various substrate models (scalar fields, GA, NLDE, Rules, Non-Local Networks, Iteration Dynamics+Koopman) aiming to derive emergent physics consistent with EQR principles. All substrate models were ultimately **falsified or terminated** due to insurmountable conceptual, computational, or analytical validation barriers (failure to derive structure, constants, or validate core mechanisms like Born rule emergence). The most robust output was the **standalone EQR v1.0 framework** (`[[EQR v1.0 Framework Report.md]]`), defining a conceptual model for the *process* of quantum manifestation based on interaction, stability/resolution ($\mathcal{R}$), probabilistic update ($P_k$), state update ($\rightarrow |k\rangle$), and information limits ($j_0 \approx \hbar$). IO v4.2 concluded after attempts to validate the ID+Koopman model hit barriers (Sprints 76, 77, 78 showed simulation consistency but failure of simplified analysis and intractability of required rigorous analysis).

## Phase EFD v1.1: EQR Formalism Development (Sprints EFD-1.1.1 - EFD-1.1.27)

*   **EFD Initiation (Post-IO v4.2 Conclusion):** Initiated phase focused solely on formal development of EQR v1.0 within RQFT, aiming to translate concepts into rigorous mathematical language and address consistency, particularly Lorentz covariance and Born rule justification. Scope explicitly excluded substrate derivation. (Sprint EFD-1.1).
*   **Sprint EFD-1.1.1 (Translate Postulates to RQFT):** Mapped EQR postulates P1-P6 onto RQFT concepts (Fock space/functionals, local interactions $\mathcal{L}_I/\mathcal{H}_I$, pointer basis states $|k\rangle$, Born rule application, hypersurface update target, $j_0=\hbar$). Identified covariant update (P5) and Born rule justification (P4) as key challenges. **Outcome:** Success; conceptual translation achieved.
*   **Sprint EFD-1.1.2 (Explore Covariant Update):** Reviewed approaches (hypersurface dependence, detector models, AQFT). Identified hypersurface-dependent formalism and explicit detector models as most promising for EQR. **Outcome:** Success; viable strategies identified.

*   **Sprint EFD-1.1.9 (Environment State Orthogonality):** Formalized argument for $\langle E_k | E_{k'}\rangle \approx \delta_{kk'}$ arising dynamically via decoherence/information transfer to infinite environmental modes. **Outcome:** Partial Success; argument formalized, rigorous proof difficult.

## Final Decision (End of EFD Phase / Sprint EFD-1.1.27 Analysis)

The EFD phase successfully translated the EQR v1.0 framework into a conceptually coherent picture within RQFT, including plausible mechanisms for Lorentz covariance (hypersurface dependence) and basis selection (relativistic decoherence). The most promising path for justifying the Born rule (envariance symmetry) was identified, its logic validated on toy models, and its formal setup explored. However, the attempt to rigorously execute the derivation within RQFT (Sprint EFD-1.1.27) failed at the critical step of formally constructing the required environmental symmetry operators. This revealed a reliance on assumed symmetries rather than constructive proof, representing a fundamental barrier to completing the formal derivation within this operational context. **Decision: Conclude the EQR Formalism Development (EFD) phase.** Further progress requires dedicated, advanced mathematical physics research into the identified formal challenges (rigorous envariance proof, explicit covariant update operator construction) that are beyond the scope and capabilities demonstrated here.

**Overall Conclusion:** The entire IO/EQR exploration (v0.1 - EFD v1.1) is concluded. While yielding valuable conceptual frameworks (EQR v1.0, Relativistic EQR outline), it consistently encountered insurmountable barriers when attempting the necessary validation or formal derivation steps required by the OMF.
