**Seed Prompt: IO v4.0 Development - Sprint 58 Initiation**

**Subject: Continuing Information Ontology (IO) v4.0 Development - Emergent Locality Simulation**

**Background:**
This chat session continues the development of the Information Ontology (IO) framework, a project aiming to build a fundamental theory of physics based on information principles. Previous iterations (Infomatics v0-v3.4, IO v0.x-v3.0) explored continuum field and local rule-based approaches but were ultimately falsified or reached impasses, primarily due to difficulties in demonstrating the emergence of stable, diverse particle structures and incorporating known physics like electromagnetism and quantum non-locality consistently.

The current phase, **IO v4.0**, represents a significant pivot based on lessons learned. It adopts an **I/O Process / Relational Manifestation Ontology** implemented via a **Fundamentally Non-Local Relational Network**. In this framework, spacetime and locality are *emergent*, while non-local connections (edges) are fundamental, providing a natural basis for quantum entanglement. Quantum phenomena (discreteness, probability, measurement) arise via the **Emergent Quantization from Resolution (EQR)** mechanism acting during interactions on this network.

Development is strictly governed by the **Operational Meta-Framework (OMF) v1.7**, which emphasizes emergence, calibration via qualitative structure, comparative testing, rigorous falsification (default STOP/RESET unless compelling progress), parsimony, acknowledgment of incompleteness, and clear documentation.

**Attached Documents (Context):**

1.  `IO_Framework_v4.0_Report.md`: Summarizes the IO v4.0 conceptual foundation, key findings (including successful conceptual modeling of entanglement via EQR on the non-local network in Sprint 57), and current status.
2.  `OMF_IO_v4.0.md`: Defines the OMF v1.7 rules governing our development process.
3.  `Appendix_A_IO_ProcessLog.md`: Contains the full historical log of previous sprints/turns (v0.1-v4.0 kickoff), including detailed analyses and falsification decisions.
4.  `Appendix_D_ParkingLot_Musings.md`: Captures relevant philosophical points and open questions.
5.  *(Optional but Recommended)* `Style Guide for Document Formatting.md` & `G Style Notation.md`: Define documentation standards.

**Current Status & Justification:**
The IO v4.0 framework successfully provided a compelling conceptual explanation for quantum entanglement (Sprint 57). The most critical next step, identified as the highest priority on the roadmap and essential for validating the framework's viability (OMF Calibration Criterion 4a), is to demonstrate that **effective locality and D≈3+1 dimensionality can plausibly emerge** from the fundamentally non-local network dynamics. Conceptual mechanisms were proposed in Sprint 56 (Activity-Based Rewiring, Causal Structure Dominance).

**Task for this Session (Initiating Sprint 58):**

**Goal:** To develop a minimal simulation or mathematical model demonstrating how **effective locality** can emerge from the non-local network dynamics, testing one of the mechanisms proposed in Sprint 56 (e.g., Activity-Based Rewiring or Causal Structure).

**Hypothesis:** A simple network evolution rule incorporating activity-based edge strengthening/weakening (or causal constraints) will dynamically lead a network with initial non-local connections towards a state where propagation predominantly follows local paths, and potentially exhibits D≈3+1 scaling.

**Methodology & Success Criteria:**
1.  **Model & Rule Implementation:** Implement a simulation (executable here if feasible, using minimal libraries) of an evolving network with both local and non-local edges. Implement a specific rule mechanism from Sprint 56 (e.g., edge weight increases with usage, decreases/pruned with disuse; OR implement simplified causal connection rules).
2.  **Simulation & Analysis:** Run the simulation. Measure effective path lengths (weighted by strength?) or information propagation times between distant nodes. Does the *effective* distance increase over time compared to direct non-local edges? Does the network develop highly connected local clusters? Analyze emergent dimensionality ($D_{dist}, D_{spec}$).
3.  **Validate/Falsify & Compelling Finding Check:**
    *   **Compelling Validation:** Simulation shows a clear trend towards emergent effective locality (e.g., weighted path length >> 1 for initially non-local edges) AND dimensionality stabilizing near D≈3.
    *   **Falsification:** Non-local connections remain dominant, effective locality does not emerge, or dimensionality is incorrect/unstable. This would falsify the chosen mechanism and potentially challenge IO v4.0 viability.

**Instruction:** Please proceed with Sprint 58, focusing on implementing and analyzing a feasible simulation or model to test the emergence of locality and dimensionality from the non-local network, adhering strictly to OMF v1.7. Ensure the analysis provides a concrete result for validation or falsification.
