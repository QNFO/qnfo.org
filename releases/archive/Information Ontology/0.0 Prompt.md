**Seed Prompt: Information Ontology (IO) - Foundational Exploration v0.0**

**Subject: Deriving Stable Structures from a Continuous Informational Medium**

**1. Premise & Motivation:**

Standard physical theories (Quantum Mechanics, General Relativity, Standard Model of Particles) face significant foundational challenges: incompatibility between QM and GR, the quantum measurement problem, reliance on unexplained fundamental constants and particle properties (masses, generations), the postulation of ad-hoc entities like dark matter and dark energy composing ~95% of the universe, and the use of mathematical idealizations (like *a priori* quantization via Planck's constant 'h', point particles, potentially flawed spacetime metrics like FLRW) whose validity may be questionable. This suggests the need to explore alternative foundational frameworks.

This inquiry proposes exploring a framework, tentatively called **Information Ontology (IO)**, based on the following minimalist core principles:

*   **Axiom IO-1: Fundamental Informational Medium:** Reality originates from a fundamental, **continuous medium** (denoted $\mathcal{F}$), representing pure potentiality for structure, pattern, and relation. This medium is considered ontologically prior to discrete particles, energy quanta, or spacetime geometry.
*   **Axiom IO-2: Intrinsic Dynamics:** The behavior of this medium $\mathcal{F}$ (how patterns form, propagate, and interact) is governed solely by **intrinsic dynamic principles** inherent to the medium itself. These principles embody fundamental aspects of **cyclical change** (allowing for wave-like propagation and internal periodicities) and **structural stability/organization** (allowing for persistent patterns). The fundamental parameters of the theory are *only* those defining these intrinsic properties of $\mathcal{F}$.
*   **Axiom IO-3: Emergent Localized Structures via Interaction:** Observable reality consists of **stable, localized, resonant patterns** that emerge dynamically within the field $\mathcal{F}$ as solutions to its intrinsic dynamics. These structures ("particles," "objects") are not fundamental points but persistent patterns. Their **manifestation and properties are dependent on interaction processes** which resolve the underlying potential structure of $\mathcal{F}$.

**2. Rejection of A Priori Assumptions:**

Crucially, this exploration explicitly **rejects** the following common assumptions from the outset:
*   No *a priori* quantization (i.e., no fundamental Planck constant 'h'). Discreteness must emerge.
*   No *a priori* assumption of specific geometric constants (like π or φ) governing dynamics via specific exponential scaling laws (like $M \propto \phi^k$) or simple resonance conditions ($\phi^k \approx N \pi$, etc.), unless such constants and relationships *emerge naturally* from the dynamics.
*   No *a priori* targeting of specific particle spectra or properties derived from potentially flawed Standard Model interpretations (e.g., 3 generations, specific quark/lepton masses).
*   No initial reliance on complex pre-existing mathematical structures (like specific Lie groups E8, advanced knot theory, or specific GA formalisms) unless simple dynamics lead demonstrably towards them.

**3. Initial Task: Exploring the Simplest Model**

To begin exploring the consequences of these axioms, we must start with the absolute simplest mathematical instantiation capable of supporting emergent structure:

*   **Field Representation:** Model the informational medium $\mathcal{F}$ using the simplest possible continuous field: a **real scalar field**, denoted $\psi(x, t)$.
*   **Dynamics:** Model the intrinsic dynamics using the simplest non-linear wave equation known to support stable, localized structures and pattern formation, incorporating a fundamental propagation speed $c_0$ and intrinsic field parameters $\mu, \lambda$:
    **(Equation IO-1):** $(\frac{1}{c_0^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2_{space}) \psi + V'(\psi) = 0$
    where $V(\psi)$ is the $\psi^4$ potential (allowing for non-trivial vacuum structure): $V(\psi) = \frac{\mu^2}{2} \psi^2 + \frac{\lambda}{4} \psi^4$. (Note: We choose signs here assuming $\psi=0$ is unstable if $\mu^2 < 0$, leading to symmetry breaking, a common mechanism for structure. Let's use $\mu^2$ directly, positive or negative as needed). Assume $c_0, \mu^2, \lambda$ are the only fundamental parameters for now.
*   **Objective:** Investigate this minimal model. **What are the fundamental, stable, localized, particle-like solutions (e.g., static lumps, kinks in 1D, oscillons/breathers in 3D) admitted by Equation IO-1 in 3+1 dimensions?** Focus on existence and stability conditions (considering Derrick's theorem, etc.).

**4. Analysis Methodology:**

*   Characterize any stable solutions found by their basic properties (spatial profile, energy/mass, internal frequency if applicable) derived *only* from the equation and parameters $c_0, \mu, \lambda$.
*   Analyze how these properties depend on the parameters.
*   Avoid interpreting these solutions immediately as specific known particles. First, understand the spectrum of possibilities generated by the simplest possible IO model.

**This prompt establishes the minimalist axiomatic foundation, defines the simplest concrete model consistent with those axioms, sets a clear initial task (finding stable solutions), and mandates a methodology focused on internal derivation and avoidance of past assumptions.**
