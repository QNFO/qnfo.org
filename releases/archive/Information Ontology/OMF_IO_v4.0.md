  v1.7 (2025-04-17): Added Rule 11: Persistent Adversarial Critique & Comparative Evaluation. Mandates continuous self-critique, active consideration of contrarian viewpoints, and regular comparison against the explanatory power of established paradigms, explicitly asking "What if we're wrong? How would we know?". Regenerated full OMF text.
  v1.6 (2025-04-17): Adapted OMF for IO v4.0 (Non-Local Network + EQR). Updated Section 2 (Core Logic) and Rule 4 (Calibration) to reflect non-local network approach. Regenerated full OMF text.
  v1.5 (2025-04-16): Refined Rule 10 (Incompleteness & Process Focus). Added reference to Appendix D. Regenerated full OMF text.
  v1.4 (2025-04-16): Added Rule 10. Added Section 4 (Doc/Style). Added `previous_versions`. Regenerated full OMF text.
  v1.3 (2025-04-16): Added Rule 9. Regenerated full OMF text.
  v1.2 (2025-04-16): Expanded Rule 5. Added Rule 8.
  v1.1 (2025-04-16): Added Rule 7.
  v1.0 (2025-04-16): Initial formalization for IO v3.0.

# Operational Meta-Framework (OMF) for Information Ontology (IO) v4.0

## 1. Preamble
*(Content remains as in previous v1.6 draft)*
This document defines the Operational Meta-Framework (OMF)... established based on the core IO logical foundation (L1-L5, Non-Local Network)... incorporates critical lessons learned... Adherence to this OMF is mandatory... parking broader philosophical questions for separate consideration (see Appendix D).

## 2. Core Logical Foundation (IO v4.0 Recap - Non-Local Network)
*(Content remains as in previous v1.6 draft)*
Development proceeds from the I/O Process / Relational Manifestation Ontology, implemented via a Fundamentally Non-Local Relational Network:
*   **L1: Potential for Observation/Interaction:** ...
*   **L2: Manifestation via Interaction & Contrast (κ, ε):** ...
*   **L3: Existence as Stable Manifested Contrast (Î):** ...
*   **L4: Relational Network as Substrate (I):** ...
*   **L5: Rules of Network Evolution & Manifestation (EQR):** ...

## 3. Operational Meta-Framework Rules
*(Content of Rules 1-10 remains as in previous v1.6 draft)*

1.  **Primacy of Logic & Ontology...**
2.  **Focus on Emergence...**
3.  **Interaction/Resolution (EQR) is Central...**
4.  **Calibration via Emergent Structure & Universality...**
5.  **Mandatory Comparative Testing, Falsification & Pivoting...**
6.  **Parsimony and Justification...**
7.  **Bootstrapping & Self-Compliance...**
8.  **Distinction Between Conceptual Analysis and Simulation Validation...**
9.  **Complete & Explicit Documentation...**
10. **Acknowledgment of Incompleteness & Process Focus...**
11. **Persistent Adversarial Critique & Comparative Evaluation (New Rule - Anti-Trap: Dogma / Ignoring Standard Model Success):**
    *   **Rule:** Maintain a persistent state of critical self-assessment and actively seek out contrarian viewpoints or alternative explanations. Regularly and explicitly compare the explanatory power, parsimony, and predictive success of the developing IO framework against established paradigms (Standard Model, GR, ΛCDM), even acknowledging their known flaws. Continuously ask: **"What if this IO approach is fundamentally wrong? How would we know? Is it *actually better* than the standard explanation for phenomenon X, or just different?"**
    *   **Accountability:** Sprints or review phases should periodically include explicit "Devil's Advocate" analysis or comparison to standard explanations for key phenomena. Progress requires not just internal consistency or novel concepts, but demonstrating tangible advantages (e.g., resolving paradoxes, greater parsimony, novel verified predictions) over established theories. Failure to demonstrate clear advantages over standard models for core phenomena, even if internal consistency is maintained, can trigger Rule 5 (STOP/RESET).

## 4. Documentation and Style Conventions
*(Content remains as in previous v1.6 draft)*
All documentation produced within the IO project must adhere to established conventions (`[[Style.md]]`, `[[releases/archive/Infomatics/v3.4/G Style Notation]] or successor).
*(Subsections 4.1-4.8 detailing Format, Prose, Terminology, Tone, Citations, Formatting, Metadata, Notation remain as in v1.5)*

## 5. Application

This Operational Meta-Framework (OMF) version 1.7 governs all subsequent development within the IO v4.0 framework (Non-Local Network + EQR) and any potential future iterations. It serves as the binding standard against which all research activities, progress, documentation, and decisions will be measured and held accountable, emphasizing rigorous self-critique and comparison to established knowledge.
