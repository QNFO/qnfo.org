# Einstein Was Wrong

**He Admitted His “Biggest Blunder.” Why Won’t Cosmologists?**

*Rowan Brad Quni, Principal Investigator, [QNFO](http://QNFO.org)*

*From dark matter myths to multiverse fantasies, modern cosmology has become a house of cards built on wishful thinking. It’s time to admit we don’t know everything—and start asking better questions.*

## **The Original Blunder—and Why It Matters**

In 1917, Albert Einstein added a fudge factor to his equations of general relativity to force them to describe a static universe. He called it the “cosmological constant,” a mathematical tweak that masked gaps in his understanding. When Edwin Hubble later proved the universe was expanding, Einstein famously called this constant his “biggest blunder.”

But here’s the catch: Einstein’s mistake was small compared to what came next. Modern cosmologists resurrected his discarded fudge factor in the 1990s to explain *accelerated* expansion, rebranding it as “dark energy.” Today, this dark energy (alongside “dark matter”) is said to make up 95% of the universe—despite no one having ever directly observed either.

## **The Dark Matter Delusion**

Dark matter was invented to explain why galaxies rotate faster than Newtonian physics allows. Scientists assumed invisible matter must be pulling everything together. But decades of searches—using particle detectors, telescopes, and supercomputers—have come up empty.

Meanwhile, a simpler idea called Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) consistently explains galactic behavior *without* dark matter. But mainstream cosmology ignores it. Why? Because dark matter is a cash cow. It fuels grants, Nobel Prizes, and academic careers. Science writer Lee Billings calls it “the physics that ate academia.”

## **The Multiverse Myth and String Theory: Science or Science Fiction?**

Cosmology’s crisis isn’t just about dark stuff. It’s about theories so divorced from reality they belong in sci-fi novels.

The **multiverse hypothesis** claims our universe is just one of infinitely many, generated by cosmic inflation. But since we can’t observe or test other universes, this idea is unscientific by definition.

**String theory** fares no better. It posits that reality is built from tiny vibrating strings—but to make the math work, it requires extra dimensions and a “landscape” of 10⁵⁰⁰ possible universes. Physicist Lee Smolin calls it “not even wrong,” meaning it’s not testable in any meaningful way. (Is it possible that people with the name Lee are more likely to be critical thinkers?)

These theories thrive not because they’re good science, but because they’re “sexy.” They sell books, TV shows, and TED Talks. But they’re distractions from the real work of understanding our *actual* universe.

## **Why Scientists Lie to Themselves**

Cosmology’s rot starts in the classroom. Students are taught to “plug and chug” equations without questioning their meaning. A physics professor once joked, “We don’t teach you to think—just to pass exams.”

This intellectual laziness creates a feedback loop:
1. **Confirmation bias**: Data that conflicts with dogma (like discrepancies in the universe’s age) are ignored or “adjusted.”
2. **Career gatekeeping**: Critics like George Ellis and Mordehai Milgrom are sidelined for challenging the status quo.
3. **Nobel-grade fraud**: The 2011 prize for “dark energy” rewarded forcing Einstein’s fudge factor into equations—not actual discovery.

## **A Path Forward: Embrace Ignorance**

1. **Stop pretending we know everything**: Acknowledge that 95% of the universe is a mystery.
2. **Amplify outsiders**: Listen to voices like Milgrom, whose MOND challenges dark matter orthodoxy.
3. **Teach critical thinking**: Train scientists to question assumptions, not just crunch numbers.

Einstein’s honesty—admitting his error—made room for progress. Modern cosmology needs the same courage. Until then, we’re just telling fairy tales with math. The universe isn’t obligated to fit our equations. It’s time to stop lying to ourselves—and start exploring the questions we’re too afraid to ask.
