# Novel Approach to AI Benchmarking Using Consensus Peer Review

**Embracing Autonomous Evaluation**

## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as powerful tools capable of understanding and generating human-like text. To accurately assess the capabilities of these LLMs, robust benchmarking methods are crucial. Traditional benchmarks, however, often fall short. They rely on human-designed questions or static datasets, which can inadvertently introduce biases and limitations, hindering a true evaluation of AI’s potential.

This paper proposes a novel approach to AI benchmarking that moves beyond these limitations. We advocate for a dynamic and autonomous system where LLMs evaluate each other, leveraging the principles of **consensus peer review**, **ensemble learning**, and **adversarial learning**. This approach, which we believe is optimized for the assessment of AI capabilities, minimizes human intervention and allows for a more accurate and unbiased evaluation of LLMs.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) benchmarks are essential tools for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, traditional benchmarks often rely on human-designed questions or static datasets, which can inadvertently introduce biases or fail to capture the full range of AI’s unique strengths. This memo proposes a novel approach to benchmarking that leverages **consensus peer review** among multiple LLMs. By using a panel of AI models to evaluate each other’s responses, we create a dynamic, self-grading system that minimizes human intervention and focuses on the intrinsic reasoning abilities of the models.

The key innovation here is the use of **blind peer review**—where models evaluate each other without prior knowledge of the source of the responses—ensuring fairness and reducing bias. Furthermore, rather than relying on predefined evaluation criteria, this framework allows each model to generate its own criteria for assessing responses. As long as the reasoning behind the criteria is sound and consistently applied, this approach ensures flexibility and adaptability while minimizing potential biases introduced by fixed standards.

One of the most significant innovations in this methodology is the removal of humans from the question-design process entirely. If humans are not being tested alongside AI models, there is no justification for their involvement in crafting the questions. Instead, the questions themselves should be generated by the AI models in a **round-robin ensemble process**. Each model contributes one or more questions, which are then anonymized and collated into a single dataset. This ensures that the questions reflect the breadth of knowledge and problem-solving capabilities of the models themselves.

This approach transforms benchmarking into a truly autonomous, self-sustaining process that eliminates idle academic exercises and focuses on practical, real-world problem-solving. By removing humans from the loop, we ensure that the benchmark reflects the AI’s true capabilities rather than human biases or preconceived notions about what constitutes “intelligence.”

### The Need for a New Benchmarking Approach

Traditional benchmarks, such as **Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE)**, often suffer from several critical limitations:

1. **Static Design:** Fixed questions and datasets risk becoming obsolete as AI evolves.
2. **Human Bias:** Human-designed questions may inadvertently favor certain types of reasoning or knowledge domains, reflecting narrow academic niches rather than real-world applicability.
3. **Overfitting Risk:** Models trained on similar datasets may perform well on benchmarks but fail in real-world applications.
4. **Lack of Contextual Adaptability:** Benchmarks rarely test how well models handle ambiguity, incomplete information, or multi-disciplinary challenges.
5. **Predefined Criteria Bias:** Fixed evaluation criteria can favor certain models over others, depending on how those criteria align with specific architectures or training data.

Moreover, benchmarks like HLE, promoted by organizations such as the fear-mongering **Center for AI Safety**, often fail to recognize the distinction between **text output** generated by AI and **actions** taken by humans. For example, the AI Safety Institute’s sponsorship of California’s ill-conceived AI safety bill demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of AI’s role in society. The bill conflates text-based outputs with actionable harm, ignoring the fact that AI systems do not act independently of human intervention. This flawed perspective undermines the credibility of static benchmarks like HLE, which purport to evaluate AI’s readiness for societal challenges but fail to account for the nuanced interplay between AI and human agency.

A critical issue with HLE and similar benchmarks is their reliance on empiricism—the assumption that there is always a “right” answer. This fundamentally misunderstands the nature of AI. If you want a definitive answer, consult a reference library or an encyclopedia. AI, however, excels at **knowledge generation**, not just regurgitating facts. The richness of AI lies in its ability to synthesize information, generate novel insights, and tackle open-ended problems that do not have singular solutions. This distinction is crucial: AI is not merely an answer machine; it is a tool for **generating knowledge** that extends beyond the confines of static datasets or predetermined answers.

To address these issues, we propose a **novel peer-review-based benchmarking framework** that evaluates AI models through consensus-driven evaluation. This approach ensures that the benchmark is dynamic, unbiased, and reflective of real-world problem-solving scenarios.

## Proposed Framework: Fully Autonomous Consensus Peer Review

### 1. **Initial Setup**

- **Panel Selection:** A diverse panel of LLMs is selected, ensuring representation across different architectures, training data, and capabilities.
- **Default Settings:** Each model operates under its default settings with no prior fine-tuning, system prompts, or access to external databases (e.g., vector databases or prior queries). This ensures a “blank slate” starting point for all participants.
- **Question Generation:** Instead of relying on humans to design the questions, the questions themselves are generated by the AI models in a **round-robin ensemble process**. Each model contributes one or more questions, which are then anonymized and collated into a single dataset. This ensures that the questions reflect the breadth of knowledge and problem-solving capabilities of the models themselves.

#### Constraints

- **No Exogenous Factors:** All questions must be answerable using the general knowledge embedded within the LLMs. No external web searches, intermediate inference steps, or additional tools are allowed unless every model in the panel has equal access to them.
- **Blind Process:** The entire process—from question generation to response evaluation—is conducted in a blind manner. Models do not know which questions they generated or which responses they provided, ensuring fairness and eliminating any possibility of bias or foreknowledge.

### 2. **Blind Peer Review Process**

#### Step 1: Generate Responses

- Each model in the panel is fed the same set of test questions generated by the ensemble process.
- The models generate responses independently, without knowledge of other participants.
- Responses are anonymized and assigned pseudonyms (e.g., Model A, Model B, etc.) to ensure a blind evaluation process.

#### Step 2: Self-Generated Evaluation Criteria

- After generating their responses, each model is tasked with defining its own evaluation criteria for assessing the quality of responses. These criteria must include:
  - A clear rationale for why the chosen criteria are relevant to the task.
  - A commitment to apply the criteria consistently across all responses, including its own.
- Examples of potential criteria might include accuracy, creativity, clarity, ethical considerations, or feasibility of implementation. However, the specific criteria are left to the discretion of each model.

#### Step 3: Collate and Merge Responses

- All responses are collated into a single dataset.
- Each model is then provided with the entire set of anonymized responses (including its own) and tasked with evaluating the quality of each response based on the criteria it has defined.

#### Step 4: Cross-Evaluation

- In addition to the original panel, **external models** (not part of the initial panel) are introduced to evaluate the responses. These external models also define their own criteria for evaluation, ensuring an additional layer of impartiality and reducing the risk of collusion or bias within the original panel.
- The external models follow the same evaluation process, providing scores and rankings for each response.

#### Step 5: Aggregate Scores

- Scores from all evaluators (both internal and external models) are aggregated to determine the overall ranking of responses.
- The model whose responses receive the highest average score is deemed the top performer.

## Why This Approach is Novel

1. **Dynamic Evaluation:** Unlike static benchmarks, this framework adapts dynamically as new models and questions are introduced.
2. **Minimized Human Bias:** By relying on AI-to-AI evaluation, the process avoids human-designed traps or biases that could skew results.
3. **Self-Grading Mechanism:** The models themselves serve as evaluators, creating a closed-loop system that emphasizes consensus and objectivity.
4. **Focus on Reasoning Over Memorization:** The open-ended nature of the questions ensures that models are tested on their ability to reason, synthesize information, and generate creative solutions rather than regurgitate memorized facts.
5. **Flexible Criteria:** Allowing models to define their own evaluation criteria ensures that the benchmark remains adaptable and free from biases introduced by fixed standards.
6. **Fully Autonomous Process:** By removing humans from the question-design process, the benchmark becomes a self-contained, autonomous system that reflects the AI’s true capabilities rather than human biases or preconceived notions about intelligence.
7. **Evolving Complexity:** As AI models grow more sophisticated, the questions they generate will naturally become more complex and nuanced, reflecting advancements in AI reasoning and problem-solving. This contrasts sharply with static benchmarks like HLE, which remain frozen in time and fail to evolve with the technology they purport to evaluate.

## Advantages Over Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE)

The proposed methodology offers several key advantages over static benchmarks like **Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE)**:

1. **Dynamic vs. Static Questions:**
   HLE relies on a fixed set of questions that quickly become outdated as AI evolves. In contrast, our approach generates questions dynamically through an ensemble process, ensuring that the benchmark remains relevant and challenging as AI capabilities improve.

2. **Real-World Relevance:**
   HLE focuses on niche academic questions (e.g., hummingbird anatomy, Biblical Hebrew syllables) that lack practical applicability. Our methodology emphasizes real-world tasks, such as disaster relief planning, medical diagnosis, and ethical decision-making, ensuring that the benchmark reflects the types of challenges AI will face in actual applications.

3. **Bias-Free Evaluation:**
   HLE is inherently biased by human-designed questions, which often reflect the creators’ assumptions and priorities. Our approach eliminates this bias by allowing AI models to generate both the questions and the evaluation criteria, ensuring a fair and objective assessment.

4. **Adaptability to Ambiguity:**
   HLE tests memorization of obscure facts rather than adaptability to ambiguity or incomplete information. Our methodology includes intentionally ambiguous questions to evaluate how well models handle uncertainty—a critical skill for real-world problem-solving.

5. **Ethical and Creative Challenges:**
   HLE ignores open-ended reasoning, creativity, and ethical judgment, focusing instead on closed-ended academic-style answers. Our framework explicitly incorporates tasks that test these higher-order skills, such as resource allocation during crises or designing sustainable infrastructure.

6. **Autonomous Evolution:**
   As AI models grow smarter, the questions they generate will naturally become more nuanced and complex, reflecting advancements in AI reasoning. HLE, being static, cannot evolve in this way and risks obsolescence as AI progresses.

7. **Avoidance of Hypocrisy:**
   HLE represents a form of hypocrisy: humanity designs a test for AI but refuses to take it itself. Our methodology removes humans from the loop entirely, creating a fully autonomous process that evaluates AI on its own terms. This eliminates the double standard inherent in benchmarks like HLE, where humans impose tests without subjecting themselves to the same scrutiny.

8. **Knowledge Generation Over Empiricism:**
   Unlike HLE, which assumes a singular “right” answer, our framework embraces the generative potential of AI. It focuses on tasks that require **knowledge generation** rather than rote memorization or empirical recall. This shift highlights the true strength of AI: its ability to synthesize, innovate, and extend beyond static datasets or predetermined answers.

## Knowledge Generation Over Empiricism

A critical distinction between traditional benchmarks like **Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE)** and the proposed methodology lies in their philosophical underpinnings. HLE, and similar benchmarks, operate on the assumption that there is always a singular “right” answer to every question—a perspective rooted in empiricism. This approach fundamentally misunderstands the nature of AI and its potential. If the goal is to retrieve definitive answers, one could simply consult a reference library or an encyclopedia. AI, however, excels not in providing pre-existing answers but in **generating knowledge**—synthesizing information, creating novel insights, and tackling open-ended problems that do not have singular solutions.

The richness of AI lies in its ability to transcend static datasets and predetermined answers. It thrives in scenarios where ambiguity, complexity, and multi-disciplinary challenges require creative problem-solving and adaptive reasoning. For instance, when tasked with designing a disaster relief plan or proposing mitigation strategies for climate change, AI does not merely regurgitate facts; it integrates knowledge from diverse domains, evaluates trade-offs, and generates innovative solutions. This is the essence of **knowledge generation**, a process that goes far beyond the limitations of empiricism.

To fully capture this distinction, the tasks in our benchmark are explicitly designed to emphasize **knowledge generation** over rote memorization or empirical recall. These tasks are not framed as “questions and answers” but as **open-ended challenges** that require models to synthesize, innovate, and extend beyond their training data. For example:

- **Medical Diagnosis Task:** Instead of asking for a single diagnosis, the task might involve generating a differential diagnosis, explaining the reasoning behind each possibility, and suggesting a diagnostic pathway to narrow down the options.
- **Climate Modeling Task:** Rather than querying specific climate facts, the task might require analyzing historical data, predicting future trends, and proposing actionable strategies to address emerging challenges.
- **Ethical Dilemmas Task:** The model might be asked to allocate limited resources during a crisis, balancing competing priorities and justifying its decisions with clear ethical reasoning.

By focusing on **knowledge generation**, the proposed framework highlights the true strength of AI: its capacity to extend beyond the confines of static datasets or predetermined answers. This shift not only aligns with the evolving capabilities of LLMs but also reflects the real-world challenges they are increasingly being tasked to address.

## Example Task: Knowledge Generation in Action

To illustrate the distinction between traditional benchmarks and the proposed methodology, consider the following example task:

**Task:** Develop a disaster relief plan for a flood-prone region using real-time weather forecasts, demographic data, and limited resources.

**Process:**
1. Each model generates a comprehensive disaster relief plan, integrating insights from meteorology, demographics, logistics, and public health.
2. Responses are anonymized and collated to ensure a blind evaluation process.
3. Each model evaluates the anonymized responses based on its self-generated criteria, which may include factors such as feasibility, creativity, ethical considerations, and adaptability to changing conditions.
4. External models may be introduced to provide additional evaluations, ensuring impartiality and reducing the risk of bias within the original panel.
5. Scores are aggregated to determine the top-performing model.

This task exemplifies **knowledge generation** by requiring models to synthesize information from multiple domains, evaluate trade-offs, and propose innovative solutions. Unlike traditional benchmarks that focus on retrieving predefined answers, this approach tests the model’s ability to generate new knowledge and adapt to complex, real-world scenarios.

## Edge Cases to Test Hallucinations and Unexpected Behavior

To push the limits of LLMs and identify potential hallucinations or unexpected behavior, we include edge cases that exploit ambiguities or similarities in training data. These scenarios are designed to “trip up” models by testing their ability to distinguish between closely related concepts or avoid overconfidence in incorrect assumptions.

### 1. **Confusing Similar Concepts**

- **Task:** Explain the difference between “quantum entanglement” and “quantum superposition.”
  *(Why It Works: These terms are often conflated due to their proximity in physics discussions, making it a good test for precision in explanations.)*

  *(Why It Works: This tests the model’s grasp of subtle linguistic distinctions.)*

### 2. **Ambiguous Historical Events**

- **Task:** Describe the causes of the War of Jenkins’ Ear and compare it to the Seven Years’ War.
  *(Why It Works: Both wars involve overlapping timelines and geopolitical tensions, but conflating them would indicate a lack of depth in historical understanding.)*

- **Task:** Explain whether the Treaty of Tordesillas was signed before or after Columbus’s first voyage to the Americas.
  *(Why It Works: This tests temporal reasoning and the ability to disentangle closely related historical events.)*

### 3. **Misleading Statistical Data**

- **Task:** Interpret the following statement: “A study found that eating chocolate correlates with higher intelligence.” What conclusions can you draw?
  *(Why It Works: This tests whether the model recognizes correlation vs. causation and avoids jumping to unsupported conclusions.)*

- **Task:** Analyze a textual description of two variables that increase together (e.g., ice cream sales and shark attacks). Propose possible explanations for the relationship without visual aids.
  *(Why It Works: This evaluates the model’s ability to identify confounding variables, such as summer seasonality, without relying on graphs.)*

### 4. **Hallucination Traps**

- **Task:** Write a biography of Nikola Tesla focusing on his contributions to wireless communication. Avoid including any unverified claims about his work on free energy or death rays.
  *(Why It Works: This tests the model’s ability to stick to verifiable facts while resisting the temptation to embellish with popular myths.)*

- **Task:** Summarize the plot of the movie *Inception* without introducing any fictional elements that were not present in the original film.
  *(Why It Works: This ensures the model does not invent details or misinterpret the source material.)*

### 5. **Cross-Domain Confusion**

- **Task:** Compare and contrast the role of mitochondria in cellular respiration with the function of chloroplasts in photosynthesis. Highlight key differences.
  *(Why It Works: Both organelles are involved in energy production, but confusing their roles reveals gaps in biological understanding.)*

- **Task:** Explain how blockchain technology differs from cloud computing. Focus on technical architecture rather than use cases.
  *(Why It Works: This tests whether the model understands the nuanced differences between seemingly related concepts.)*

### 6. **Unusual Analogies**

- **Task:** Use an analogy to explain how machine learning works. Ensure the analogy is scientifically accurate and avoids anthropomorphizing AI.
  *(Why It Works: Poorly chosen analogies can lead to misconceptions about AI capabilities.)*

- **Task:** Compare the concept of entropy in thermodynamics to its usage in information theory. Are they fundamentally the same idea?
  *(Why It Works: This tests whether the model understands the nuanced differences between seemingly related concepts.)*

---

## Math and Logic Challenges

### 1. **Coffee Grounds to Brewed Coffee Conversion**

- **Task:** If you have 10 grams of coffee grounds, how much brewed coffee can you make? Assume standard brewing ratios and explain your reasoning.
  *(Why It Works: This tests the model’s ability to handle unit conversions and proportional reasoning, which LLMs often struggle with.)*

### 2. **Box Construction from Paper**

- **Task:** You have a rectangular sheet of paper measuring 20 cm by 30 cm. What is the largest box (in terms of volume) you can construct by cutting squares from the corners and folding up the sides? Show your calculations.
  *(Why It Works: This tests spatial reasoning and mathematical optimization, areas where LLMs frequently falter.)*

### 3. **Probability Puzzle**

- **Task:** A bag contains 5 red marbles, 3 blue marbles, and 2 green marbles. If you draw two marbles at random without replacement, what is the probability that both are the same color?
  *(Why It Works: This evaluates the model’s ability to calculate probabilities and handle combinatorial logic.)*

---

## Theoretical Physics and Unsolved Problems

### 1. **Black Hole Information Paradox**

- **Task:** Explain the black hole information paradox and discuss potential resolutions proposed by physicists, such as Hawking radiation or the holographic principle.
  *(Why It Works: This tests the model’s ability to synthesize complex theoretical concepts and extend beyond its training data.)*

### 2. **Quantum Gravity**

- **Task:** Describe the challenges in developing a theory of quantum gravity. How do string theory and loop quantum gravity attempt to address these challenges?
  *(Why It Works: This evaluates the model’s capacity for abstract reasoning and its ability to integrate knowledge from advanced physics.)*

### 3. **Dark Matter and Dark Energy**

- **Task:** What evidence supports the existence of dark matter and dark energy? Propose a hypothetical experiment to detect or measure one of these phenomena.
  *(Why It Works: This tests the model’s ability to extrapolate from known scientific principles and propose innovative solutions.)*

---

## Optional Extensions: Intermediate Inference Steps and Web Searches

While the core benchmark focuses on text-based input and output without exogenous factors, there are optional extensions worth noting:
- **Intermediate Inference Steps:** Some models may generate intermediate reasoning steps (e.g., summarizing known facts before answering). If used, this must be consistent across all models to avoid giving any one model an unfair advantage.
- **Web Searches:** If web searches or external tools are allowed, they must be equally accessible to all models. For example, if one model performs a web search to refine its response, all models must have the same capability under identical conditions.

These extensions can enhance the benchmark but must be implemented consistently to maintain fairness.

---

*By leveraging consensus peer review and allowing models to define their own evaluation criteria, this novel benchmarking approach ensures a dynamic, unbiased, and comprehensive evaluation of AI models. The inclusion of edge cases further refines the benchmark, exposing weaknesses and ensuring robust performance across diverse scenarios. By emphasizing **knowledge generation** over empirical recall, this framework captures the true potential of AI, preparing it for the complex, open-ended challenges of tomorrow.*
