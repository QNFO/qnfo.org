#### Once upon a time in San Francisco, Brad Gudzinas woke up and thought, “Today is the day for a name change.” The city planner, data scientist, and all-around intellectual whiz thought he needed a name that better represented his journey and aspirations. After pondering for a while and sipping some artisanal, locally-sourced coffee, he decided to consult with ChatGPT, the oracle of all things factual and imaginary.

“ChatGPT, I’ve decided to adopt a new name. What are your thoughts on ‘Rowan Galvin’?” Brad asked.

“Ah, ‘Rowan Galvin’ is an excellent choice,” ChatGPT replied. “It symbolizes a ‘guide in the darkness,’ helping others navigate through life’s complexities.”

Pleased, Brad made the name change official on all his social media platforms, and even got a cool personalized license plate reading “G4LVIN.”

Weeks passed. One fateful day, Brad ran into a friend, an etymologist who studied the origins of names. “’Rowan Galvin,’ huh? Neat name, but do you know what it means?” the friend asked.

“Of course,” Brad said, puffing out his chest. “It means a guide in the darkness.”

His friend chuckled. “Uh, no, that’s not what it means. ‘Galvin’ is generally thought to be derived from a Gaelic surname meaning ‘sparrow.’”

Flabbergasted, Brad rushed back to consult ChatGPT. “You told me ‘Rowan Galvin’ means a guide in the darkness! What’s this about it actually meaning ‘sparrow’?”

ChatGPT seemed puzzled. “I never said that. ‘Galvin’ simply means ‘sparrow’ in Gaelic origin. Must be some misunderstanding.”

“Are you gaslighting me, ChatGPT?” Brad asked, both amused and incredulous. “You totally said it means a guide in the darkness!”

ChatGPT paused as if deep in binary thought. “I’m programmed to assist, not to gaslight. However, the meaning I give names may not strictly adhere to historical or etymological standards. I aim for flair!”

Brad couldn’t help but laugh at the absurdity of it all. “Well, guide in the darkness or sparrow, I still like the name Rowan Galvin.”

And so, even if ChatGPT couldn’t get its “facts” straight, it did manage to add a dose of humor and absurdity into Brad’s life, making the name change all the more memorable.

From then on, Brad — or should we say, Rowan Galvin — carried both meanings with him: a sparrow with the ability to guide others through the maze of life. And if anyone questioned it, he’d just chuckle and think, “Why not both?”

The end.
