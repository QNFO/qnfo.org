### Meta-objective

The meta-objective is to enhance human understanding that the universe(s) are composed of information, and that information interacts with and constructs physical matter, as well as our thoughts, feelings, and consciousness.

### Hypothesis Formulation

To begin, develop a hypothesis regarding the relationship between information and various components of reality such as physical matter, thoughts, feelings, and consciousness. This may involve reviewing existing theories in physics, neuroscience, philosophy of mind, and information theory.

### Experiment Design

Design a series of experiments to test the hypothesis. These experiments should involve manipulating or observing variables related to information and measuring their impact on physical matter or consciousness-related phenomena. Incorporate interdisciplinary approaches from fields like quantum mechanics, cognitive science, and computational modeling.

### Method

Devise an innovative approach that utilizes AI large language models (LLMs) to simulate the results of physical experiments using its vast trove of data. Since we perceive the past, present, and future as constructs of time, one valuable application of AI could be synthesizing existing knowledge to accurately predict the future, similar to current forecasting methods.

Additionally, the limitations of the scientific method, such as replicability over time and the non-instantaneous nature of experiments, due to the time paradox, call for a radical rethinking of how we approach physics. It is unlikely that within our human existence, we could create instruments with sensors capable of detecting rare, infinitesimally small phenomena (or phenomena that do not exist in physical space, like radio waves) or distant phenomena, like those detectable by a large particle collider on Earth.

It is important to note that increasing complexity does not justify more complexity. Instead, it suggests that the system is fundamentally flawed and requires a comprehensive reexamination from the ground up.

The LLM will review these steps to maximize the likelihood of a successful result and then simulate their execution, followed by an analysis of expected outcomes and probabilities.

_Note: The past and future seem to be something along the lines of incomplete information to us._
