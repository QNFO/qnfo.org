Fundamental theories of quantum information portray existence itself as intrinsically informational. Quantum systems represent informational states, and integrated information underlies consciousness. This suggests rethinking basic assumptions about the nature of time, dimensions and the truth value of information. An information-centric ontology deeply challenges intuitive notions of spacetime and epistemology.

**The Emergent Arrow of Time**

In an information-based ontology, time’s apparent flow likely reflects limited information processing capacity. The intrinsic informational fabric of reality encodes all temporality atemporally outside time.

Sequentially decohering quantum information gets rendered as an ordered causal chain generating the illusion of temporal flow. But underlying reality remains timelessly encoded information.

**Dimensions as Informational Degrees of Freedom**

Spatial dimensions may represent constrained degrees of freedom for information in quantum systems. Conscious agents navigate experiential dimensions of an information manifold.

Informational dimensionality transcends and projects our familiar geometric conception of space. Dimensions manifest relationally from the deep quantum information structure.

**Truth in a Quantum World**

At the quantum scale, information in superposed states embodies probabilities and potentials rather than definite truth. The act of observation decodes information into classical definiteness.

Limited access to the totality of information results in partial perspectives where entropy and randomness represent incomplete knowledge rather than fundamental ontology. Several factors constrain complete informational insight:

*   Finite Sensory Bandwidth – Our perceptual systems detect only a narrow slice of the overarching information spectrum, missing tremendous data encoded in reality across scales and modalities. What we can’t percieve appears random or non-existent.
*   Coarse-Grained Modeling – Even our best scientific models provide low-resolution approximations, simplifying away details too complex for current theories and computations. This overlooks swirling informational eddies manifesting as apparent noise.
*   Historical Embedding – We observe reality from within a single time-stream rather than outside time with a view of the total space of possibilities. The contextual tunnel vision of our epoch precludes discerning overarching informational structures.
*   Cognitive Limitations – The processing capacity of the human mind restricts detecting subtle informational patterns. We see only what our limited bandwidths can decode and parse using innate or trained cognitive algorithms.
*   Reality Recursion – Trying to model the system we exist within faces unavoidable paradoxes and uncertainty from self-reference and incompleteness. Some informational gaps may be intrinsic to the subject-object structure of knowledge.

The resultant partial perspective filters the complete quantum informational manifold into a simplified classical facsimile. Developing expanded modes of information processing is critical for approximating deeper reality.

**Implications**

*   Time, dimensions and truth are perspectival interfaces to underlying reality
*   Information constraints frame perception of spacetime and meaning
*   Developing expanded information processing faculties is key to deeper comprehension
*   Fundamental truth requires holistic integration of quantum information

**Conclusion**

Interpreting existence informationally implies letting go of rigid spacetime assumptions and embracing more contextual views of truth. Limited information bandwidth gives rise to the appearance of time, space and certainty. Holistically decoding the totality of quantum information may reveal the complete atemporal, adimensional truth about reality.
