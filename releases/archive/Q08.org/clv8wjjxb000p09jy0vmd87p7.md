In todayâ€™s modern world, technology has become an integral part of our daily lives. It has revolutionized the way we communicate, work, and access information. However, while technology brings numerous benefits and convenience to many, it also imposes a high cognitive load on those who are already struggling to meet their basic needs of food, housing, clothing, and job stability.

The Overwhelming Complexity
---------------------------

One of the main reasons why technology can be overwhelming for individuals facing economic challenges is the sheer complexity of its operation. From smartphones to computers, the rapidly advancing technology requires users to constantly learn and adapt to new systems and interfaces. For those who are already working hard to make ends meet, dedicating the time and mental energy required to understand and operate these devices can be a daunting task.

Financial Burden and Lack of Control
------------------------------------

Another significant factor contributing to the high cognitive load of technology is the financial burden it presents. Access to technology can be expensive, and individuals who are struggling to meet their basic needs may not have the financial means to purchase or maintain the latest devices or pay for internet services. This lack of access not only creates a financial burden but also limits their control and privacy. For example, they may have to rely on shared computers at libraries or public spaces, where they have to abide by seemingly arbitrary rules and restrictions. This lack of control and privacy further adds to their cognitive load and makes it even more challenging for them to navigate the digital world.

Information Overload
--------------------

The digital age has brought with it an overwhelming amount of information. While this can be beneficial for those with the resources and knowledge to navigate and filter through it, individuals already facing economic hardships may find themselves inundated with information that they do not have the time or mental capacity to process effectively. This information overload can lead to decision fatigue and added stress, further burdening those who are already working hard to secure their basic necessities.

Perverse Incentives and User-Friendly Design
--------------------------------------------

It is important to note that the high cognitive load of technology does not have to be a vicious cycle. There are indeed perverse incentives for technology manufacturers to create more user-friendly designs and improve the user experience (UI/UX). By prioritizing simplicity, intuitive interfaces, and accessibility, technology can become more inclusive and less burdensome for individuals who are already facing economic challenges. By understanding the needs and limitations of these users, technology developers can create products that are easier to learn, use, and navigate, reducing the cognitive load and improving the overall experience.

Conclusion
----------

In conclusion, the high cognitive load of technology adds an extra layer of difficulty for individuals who are already struggling to meet their basic needs. The complexity, financial burden, lack of control, and information overload associated with technology can create challenges. However, by recognizing the perverse incentives and striving for user-friendly design, technology can become more accessible and less burdensome for those facing economic hardships. It is essential for policymakers, technology manufacturers, and society as a whole to prioritize the needs of these individuals and work towards creating a more inclusive and user-friendly digital world.
