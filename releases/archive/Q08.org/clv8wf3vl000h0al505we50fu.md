Whether knowledge disciplines or drugs, we have a tendency to fixate on nouns within our construct of language as destinations because having a destination somehow makes sense to our consciousness. We want to point to something and say “I’m going to Vacaville” or “I’m going to study Medicine” or “I’m going to do ketamine” (note the interesting interplay with a future-tense verb). But then that falls short because we actually don’t study medicine we end up counseling patients who just want to take whatever drug their pharmaceutical company ad says they should take, etc…
