It’s interesting that we’re not smart enough to know how human consciousness works, how we think, and how it relates to the physical environment we perceive/observe, but we (as individuals or collectively) think we “know” we are the most intelligent civilization (ever), risk a self-inflicted demise that we may or may not be able to innovate our way out of; are intelligent enough to find other life that we think is less intelligent, yet haven’t found that life; no longer speak “thou” despite “traditional” beliefs that were useful for a past we never lived and traditions very different from our own. Because we haven’t updated our information (and in some cases stubbornly refuse to do so by rejecting the premise altogether), our own ignorance/stupidity is self-validation that the rest of us should not argue with under the false banner of logic and rationality, lest we be the hypocrites. Amen.

Even Einstein wasn’t really that smart, because he knew about quantum physics, but his ego and cognitive fallacy of path dependence got in the way of validating that he could be both right and incomplete in his brilliance.

Homer Simpson knew how smrt he is, inventing the make-up gun and “everything’s OK” alarm. And while we’re telling everyone else that they are wrong, let us also remember that Jesus, Buddha, the Prophet, and even Flying Spaghetti Monster preach humility and modesty as the path to enlightenment. Remember that the next time you go through the trouble of throwing your carefully saved and bagged compost scraps in the trash, driving your Tesla to find a charging station, or ignoring a fellow human asking for money because she appears to have a new phone or his shoes “look new.” Dunning and Kruger aren’t wrong even if robbing a bank covered in lemon juice seems ridiculous… you would do it by inflating your charitable donations wouldn’t you? ![😉](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1713665967285/a8f64331-d5b3-4e30-aa9d-dc02bfd29d6e.png)
