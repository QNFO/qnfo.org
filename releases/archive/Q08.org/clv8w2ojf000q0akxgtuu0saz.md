In the realm of minds, perceptions thrive,  
A fascinating notion, our thoughts contrive,  
Yet I hold steadfast, firm in my decree,  
Our perception shapes reality's decree.  
  
For if we embrace death's grim, haunting guise,  
And dwell on destruction with fear in our eyes,  
The universe, in response, shall duly comply,  
Manifesting such darkness to meet our cry.
