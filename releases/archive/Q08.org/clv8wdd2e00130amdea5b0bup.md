I’ve been contemplating how our perception of truth often depends on the frame of reference we’re viewing it from. Claims that are blatantly false from a broader, well-informed perspective can seem entirely valid when looked at through a very narrow, uninformed lens. This connects to ideas about how our underlying assumptions and contexts profoundly shape how we interpret reality. Pure objectivity is elusive when our observations are inevitably “theory-laden” to some degree.

At the same time, I’ve realized that my subjective experience in any given moment is radically contingent and fluid. The feeling state I inhabit is a unique confluence of countless shifting variables – my environment, location, bodily sensations, thoughts and so on. There is no static, monolithic self. Reality for me is an ever-unfolding stream of radically new experiential frames.

This poses a challenge as well as an opportunity. If I get too caught up obsessively analyzing past moments or anxiously fixating on future ones, I miss being fully present and attuned to how I feel right here, right now. There is freedom in not clinging to thoughts and just inhabiting this singular instance of awareness as it arises. This aligns with mindfulness teachings.

And yet, transcending the present moment through reasoning about patterns, narratives and frameworks from the past and future dimensions of time retains value. Abstract reflection allows me to create conceptual meaning. The immediate subjective experience and the more detached universal view need not be opposed – they can coexist and even enrich each other.

Ultimately, sense-making requires holding multiple perspectives integrated. Avoiding binary views of subjective vs objective, present vs eternal. Instead, being open to how radical subjectivity and drives toward transcendent truth mutually arise and can be bridged. Making peace with this profound complexity is key to mapping the depths of human existence across fleeting moments and overarching reality.
