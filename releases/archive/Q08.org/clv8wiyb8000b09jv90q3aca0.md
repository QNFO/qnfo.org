**Introduction:**  
This survey and literature review aim to provide an overview of alternative physics theories, exploring frameworks that go beyond classical theories like Newtonian mechanics and relativity. The focus is on theories that have implications for our understanding of reality, consciousness, and the fundamental nature of the universe.

**1\. Quantum Mechanics Extensions:**

*   _Background:_ Some alternative physics theories extend quantum mechanics beyond its traditional domain, proposing applications at macroscopic scales.
*   _Notable Theories:_ De Broglie-Bohm theory, Objective Collapse Theories, and theories involving quantum field effects in the brain.
*   _Implications:_ Investigate how these extensions may influence cognitive processes and the nature of consciousness.

**2\. Multiverse and Parallel Realities:**

*   _Background:_ The idea of multiple universes or parallel realities challenges the concept of a single observable universe.
*   _Notable Theories:_ Many-worlds interpretation, cosmic inflation models leading to a multiverse.
*   _Implications:_ Explore how the existence of multiple realities may impact our perception and decision-making within the context of consciousness.

**3\. Information Theory and the Nature of Reality:**

*   _Background:_ Information theory explores the role of information processing in the universe, connecting information and fundamental physical principles.
*   _Notable Theories:_ Digital Physics, Quantum Information Theory.
*   _Implications:_ Investigate the relationship between information processing, cognitive functions, and the subjective experience of reality.

**4\. Emergent Phenomena and Complexity:**

*   _Background:_ Alternative physics theories may emphasize emergent properties and complexity that challenge reductionist approaches.
*   _Notable Theories:_ Emergent gravity, complexity theory in physics.
*   _Implications:_ Explore how emergent phenomena align with non-linear aspects of decision-making and consciousness dynamics.

**5\. Relativity and Subjectivity:**

*   _Background:_ Relativity theory highlights the subjective nature of time and space.
*   _Notable Theories:_ Relational Quantum Mechanics, theories challenging absolute time or space.
*   _Implications:_ Examine how the subjective elements of relativity connect with conscious perception and experience.

**Challenges and Criticisms:**

*   Evaluate the empirical support for alternative physics theories.
*   Consider criticisms and debates within the scientific community.
*   Highlight challenges in integrating these theories with established empirical evidence.

**Future Research Opportunities:**

*   Investigate potential experimental tests or observations that could support or challenge alternative physics theories.
*   Explore interdisciplinary connections between alternative physics and cognitive science, particularly in understanding consciousness and decision-making.
*   Foster collaborations between physicists, cognitive scientists, and philosophers to advance the integration of alternative physics into mainstream scientific discourse.

**Conclusion:**  
This survey and literature review provide a glimpse into the diverse landscape of alternative physics theories. As the scientific community continues to explore these frameworks, there are exciting opportunities for cross-disciplinary investigations that may reshape our understanding of reality, consciousness, and the fundamental principles governing the universe.
