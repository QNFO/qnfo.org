The familiar saying, “prevention is better than cure,” has become bitterly ironic in the complex world of American healthcare. Those seeking preventive interventions, such as for HIV, often find a stark contrast between the principle of prevention and the realities of accessing such measures. This essay examines the troubling gap between the availability of preventive options, like Apretude — an injectable solution for HIV prevention — and the ability of many to afford them.

Medical breakthroughs usher in new hope for robust preventive measures against HIV — specifically, Pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. Yet, financial barriers and other challenges disrupt its effective use. Personal stories reveal a heartbreaking cycle: the delayed adoption of PrEP due to costs leads to preventable HIV diagnoses. This is a cruel irony given PrEP’s very aim is to prevent infection, yet its high cost makes regular use unattainable for some.

Apretude, the bi-monthly injectable form of PrEP, offers a promising alternative to daily pills by providing consistent protection. Its introduction is met with optimism for a revolution in HIV prevention. Yet, those without health insurance soon find their hopes dashed, as the cost remains out of reach — a stark reminder of the disparities within the healthcare system.

The true test of any healthcare system is in its accessibility. When individuals, losing jobs and insurance, are met with prices around $2000 per injection, even with manufacturer discounts, the system fails this test. Questions arise as to why these life-saving drugs are not more affordable for the uninsured, revealing a critical need for systemic reform.

Service provision is another area where the system falters. Inquiries to gay health clinics in San Francisco about these issues go largely unanswered, further evidencing the need for systemic improvement. This lack of response in a crucial time reflects the broader unresponsiveness plaguing our healthcare system.

In conclusion, the preventive healthcare system in America is fraught with inconsistencies that undermine its efficacy. The struggle of many to access Apretude is a stark illustration of these issues. As a society that values prevention, it is imperative to confront these challenges and restructure our healthcare institutions to truly uphold the health and well-being of all individuals.
