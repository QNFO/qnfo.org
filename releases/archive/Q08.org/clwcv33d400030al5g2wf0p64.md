**Abstract**: The Holographic Principle posits that all information contained within a volume of space can be encoded on its boundary. This principle, if validated, could profoundly alter our understanding of the universe, suggesting that our three-dimensional reality is a projection of information encoded in a lower-dimensional space. This experiment aims to test this hypothesis by investigating the behavior of entangled photons in Earth orbit, analyzing whether their correlations align with predictions of the Holographic Principle.

**Objectives**:

1. To test the hypothesis that the informational content of a spatial volume aligns with its boundary.
    
2. To measure quantum entanglement correlations of photons in Earth orbit.
    
3. To validate theoretical predictions of the Holographic Principle through empirical data.
    
4. To explore the implications of the Holographic Principle for the informational universe theory.
    

### Background

The Holographic Principle suggests that the fundamental description of the universe can be encoded on a lower-dimensional boundary surface. This groundbreaking concept aims to bridge the gap between quantum mechanics and general relativity, potentially leading to a unified theory of quantum gravity. The informational universe theory furthers this idea by proposing that the universe operates as a vast and complex computation, where information plays a central role.

* Validate the simulation results against theoretical predictions.
    

#### Phase 3: Prototype Development and Testing (4-5 months)

**Objective**: Build and test a prototype of the experimental setup.

* Assemble a prototype based on the detailed design and selected components.
    
* Conduct extensive ground-based testing to validate the functionality of the prototype.
    
* Perform vibration and shock testing to simulate launch conditions.
    

#### Phase 4: Integration with Spacecraft and Pre-Launch Preparation (4-6 months)

**Objective**: Prepare the experimental setup for integration into the spacecraft.

* Collaborate with SpaceX to secure a payload slot on a mission to Earth orbit.
    
* Ensure all hardware and experimental protocols comply with SpaceX's safety and design guidelines.
    
* Perform final system tests and conduct dry runs of the experimental protocol.
    

#### Phase 5: Data Collection in Space (1-2 months)

**Objective**: Execute the experiment in Earth orbit and collect high-quality data.

* Ensure the experimental payload is successfully launched and deployed in Earth orbit.
    
* Generate entangled photons and measure their correlations over distances in the microgravity environment.
    
* Ensure continuous data logging and transmission back to Earth for analysis.
    

#### Phase 6: Post-Experiment Analysis and Validation (3-6 months)

**Objective**: Analyze the collected data and validate the results against theoretical predictions.

* Perform initial data processing to clean and organize the collected data.
    
* Use advanced statistical and computational techniques to analyze the data.
    
* Compare the experimental results with theoretical models of the Holographic Principle.
    
* Subject the findings to rigorous peer review to validate the conclusions.

            P0_rotated = rotated_basis * P0 * rotated_basis.dag()
            P1_rotated = rotated_basis * P1 * P1_rotated.dag()
            
            # Measurement outcomes
            outcome0 = pair.ptrace(0).overlap(P0_rotated)
            outcome1 = pair.ptrace(0).overlap(P1_rotated)
            correlation += outcome0 - outcome1
        correlations.append(correlation / len(photon_pairs))
    return correlations

correlations = detect_photons(propagated_photons, detection_angles)

# Function to analyze correlations
