A major gap in quantum information field theory (QIFT) is deriving dynamical spacetime structure and gravitational phenomena from quantum information. Causal set theory models spacetime as a locally finite partial order of discrete events (Bombelli et al., 1987), providing a natural avenue for reconstructing causal structure from informational principles. Integrating QIFT and causal sets could elevate QIFT to a fundamental theory of quantum gravity by addressing existing shortcomings.

**Central Proposition:**

The discrete causal relations between events in a causal set originate from constraints on quantum information flow and signaling imposed by the entanglement structure of the underlying QIFT state. Signaling between causally linked events corresponds to permitted information flow between entropy-correlated subsystems (Dowker et al., 2019). The emergent continuum spacetime and geometry arises from the interplay between discrete causal relations and continuous QFT entanglement patterns (Surya, 2019).

**Key Advantages:**

*   Provides information-theoretic origin for causal set order from quantum communication limits between entangled regions
*   Links signaling between events to quantum information flow between subsystems
*   Reconstructs causal structure and dynamics from entanglement constraints
*   Combines strengths of discrete causal sets and continuous QFT geometry

**Open Challenges:**

*   Establishing precise mathematical correspondence between causal sets and QIFT states
*   Deriving full gravitational dynamics from the quantum information structure
*   Resolving black hole information paradox via disrupted information flow
*   Testing for empirical signatures of the deep connection between entanglement and causality

This synthesis of QIFT and causal sets fills a critical gap by grounding causal discrete spacetime structure within the quantum information architecture. Developing this direction can elevate QIFT to a rigorous theory of quantum gravity and dynamical quantum spacetime.
