As I reflect on it in the moment, I’m overwhelmed with the thought that somehow my intellect and the wisdom of the wide world has granted me—at only mid-life—the awesome knowledge that I will never die.

Certainly my body will entropy but I offer as proof the names we all know from the ages, from Jesus of Nazareth to Einstein to Genghis Khan, and surely many other more infamous names.

We remember the magnitude of their energy. Whether they were “good” or “bad” is subjective and irrelevant because I’m learning that if I wake up every day running as fast as I can, I’ll never reach the speed of light but it turns out I may crack quantum physics (in my own way) and that needs no recognition. It is the joy of intellect that I trust will be my calling card to eternity.
