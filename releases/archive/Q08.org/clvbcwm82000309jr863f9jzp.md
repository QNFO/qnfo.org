In 1971, Saul Alinsky published his seminal work, “Rules for Radicals,” which outlined a set of tactics and strategies for community organizers and activists seeking to create social and political change. Alinsky’s rules were rooted in his experiences fighting for civil rights and economic justice in the 1960s, and they emphasized the importance of building power through collective action, confrontational tactics, and creative disruption.

Fast forward to 2024, and the world is a very different place. Climate change, wealth inequality, racial injustice, and political polarization have reached crisis levels, and the systems and institutions that were supposed to address these challenges have proven woefully inadequate. From the halls of government to the boardrooms of corporations, the [structures of power are more interested in perpetuating themselves than in serving the needs of the people.](https://quniio.wpcomstaging.com/truth/)

In this context, Alinsky’s rules, while still relevant, are in desperate need of an update. We need a new set of tactics and strategies that are responsive to the unique challenges and opportunities of our time, and that recognize the power of individual action in an era of social media and global connectivity.

That’s where these “Fucked Up Rules for Fucked Up Systems” come in. Drawing on the spirit of Alinsky’s original work, these rules are designed for individual activists who still give a shit about the world we collectively live in, and who are willing to use their voices and their bodies to create change.

These rules recognize that the systems we are up against are not just broken, but actively hostile to the values of justice, equity, and sustainability. They are rules for a world where the powerful are more interested in maintaining their own privilege than in addressing the urgent crises facing our planet and our communities.

At the same time, these rules also recognize the incredible power of individual action in the age of social media and global resistance. With the right tactics and strategies, a single person can inspire a movement, hold the powerful accountable, and create ripple effects that change the course of history.

Whether you’re seasoned or just starting out, these rules are for you. They are a call to action, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, we all have the power to create change. They are a challenge to the status quo, a declaration of resistance against the forces of oppression and injustice.

In the words of the great activist and poet Audre Lorde, “The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house.” These rules are not the master’s tools. They are the tools of the resistance, the weapons of the oppressed, the fuel for the fire of change.

Let’s use these rules to create a world where justice is not just a dream, but a reality. Let’s use our voices, our bodies, and our collective power to dismantle the fucked up systems that are destroying our planet and our communities. Let’s show the powerful that we will not be silent, we will not be complicit, and we will not back down.

If you’re an activist who still gives a shit, who won’t give up the fight even as the world seems to be crumbling around us, then it’s time to embrace the Fucked Up Rules for Radicals. It’s time to be bold, to be strong, and to fight for the change we need. It’s time to stop playing by the rules of a broken system and start building a new one – one that works for everyone.

The time for action is now. The future is ours to create. Let’s get started.

### 1\. Power is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have.

In a world of broken systems and corrupt institutions, individual activists may feel powerless to create change. However, by leveraging the power of perception, even a single person can make a difference. By speaking your truth boldly and confidently, you can create the illusion of having more support and influence than you actually do. This can be especially effective when challenging powerful interests who may underestimate the strength of individual voices.

Why it’s needed: In a society plagued by wealth inequality, racial injustice, and environmental destruction, those in power often seek to maintain the status quo by silencing dissent. By creating the perception of power, individual activists can level the playing field and amplify their message.

Example: When Greta Thunberg began her solitary climate strike outside the Swedish parliament in 2018, she was just one person with a sign. But by speaking her truth with conviction and clarity, she quickly gained a global following and became a powerful symbol of the youth climate movement.

Bold idea for individual activists: Create a personal “truth campaign” that shares your story and perspective on a particular issue through social media, op-eds, or public speaking. By putting a human face on the problem and speaking from the heart, you can build empathy and support for your cause.

### 2\. Never go outside the expertise of your people.

As an individual activist, it’s important to focus on issues and tactics that align with your own skills, knowledge, and experience. By staying within your area of expertise, you can build credibility and avoid spreading yourself too thin.

Why it’s needed: In a world of information overload and fake news, it’s easy for individual activists to get caught up in debates and controversies that are outside their depth. By focusing on what you know best, you can contribute to the larger movement in a meaningful way while maintaining your integrity.

Example: When Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician in Flint, Michigan, began to suspect that the city’s water was contaminated with lead, she focused on gathering and analyzing medical data to support her claims. By staying within her area of expertise, she was able to provide compelling evidence of the crisis and help spur action to address it.

Bold idea for individual activists: Create a personal “truth portfolio” that showcases your unique skills, experiences, and perspectives related to the issues you care about. Use this portfolio to identify opportunities for collaboration and contribution that align with your strengths.

### 3\. Whenever possible, go outside the expertise of the enemy.

As an individual activist, you may be up against powerful institutions and individuals with vast resources and expertise. By focusing on issues and tactics that your adversaries are less familiar with, you can catch them off guard and exploit their weaknesses.

Why it’s needed: In a system rigged to favor the wealthy and powerful, individual activists need to be creative and agile in their approach. By going outside the enemy’s comfort zone, you can disrupt their strategies and create new opportunities for change.

Example: When the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and their allies began protesting the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline in 2016, they used a variety of unconventional tactics, including prayer ceremonies, cultural festivals, and social media campaigns, to draw attention to their cause. By highlighting the spiritual and cultural significance of the land, they were able to build a broad coalition of support that transcended traditional political boundaries.

Bold idea for individual activists: Conduct a personal “opposition research” project to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the institutions and individuals you are trying to challenge. Use this information to develop a personal “truth strategy” that targets their blind spots and vulnerabilities.

### 4\. Make the enemy live up to their own book of rules.

One of the most powerful tools that individual activists have is the ability to hold those in power accountable to their own stated values and standards. By exposing hypocrisy and double standards, you can undermine their credibility and legitimacy.

Why it’s needed: In a world where politicians and corporations often say one thing and do another, it’s up to individual activists to call out their inconsistencies and demand integrity. By holding them accountable to their own words, you can create a powerful sense of moral outrage that can drive change.

Example: When Senator Bernie Sanders ran for president in 2016 and 2020, he frequently called out his opponents for taking campaign contributions from wealthy donors and special interests. By highlighting the corrupting influence of money in politics, he was able to build a grassroots movement based on the idea of a “political revolution” that would put power back in the hands of the people.

Bold idea for individual activists: Create a personal “truth meter” that rates the consistency and integrity of the institutions and individuals you are trying to challenge. Use this meter to call out hypocrisy and double standards whenever you see them, and to demand accountability from those in power.

### 5\. Ridicule is man’s most potent weapon.

As an individual activist, one of the most powerful tools you have is your voice. By using humor, satire, and mockery to expose the absurdity and injustice of the status quo, you can break through people’s defenses and open their minds to new possibilities.

Why it’s needed: In a world where the powerful often take themselves too seriously, individual activists can use laughter as a way to puncture their self-importance and reveal their flaws. By making people laugh, you can also make them think more critically about the world around them.

Example: When the AIDS crisis was at its height in the 1980s, activists with the group ACT UP used a variety of humorous and satirical tactics to call attention to the government’s inadequate response. One of their most famous actions involved wrapping Senator Jesse Helms’ house in a giant condom to protest his opposition to AIDS education and prevention efforts.

Bold idea for individual activists: Create a personal “truth comedy” routine that uses humor and satire to expose the absurdity and injustice of the issues you care about. Share your routine through social media, open mics, or other public forums to get people laughing and thinking at the same time.

### 6\. A good tactic is one your people enjoy.

As an individual activist, it’s important to choose tactics that align with your own values, interests, and personality. By engaging in activities that you enjoy and find meaningful, you can sustain your motivation and inspire others to join you.

Why it’s needed: Activism can be emotionally and physically draining, especially when you are working on your own. By choosing tactics that you find personally fulfilling, you can avoid burnout and maintain a sense of purpose and connection to the larger movement.

Example: When Tarana Burke started the Me Too movement in 2006, she focused on creating a safe and supportive space for survivors of sexual violence to share their stories and heal. By centering the experiences and needs of survivors, she was able to build a powerful movement that has since gone global.

Bold idea for individual activists: Create a personal “truth playlist” of songs, poems, stories, and other creative works that inspire you and reflect your values. Share this playlist with others and use it to fuel your own activism and self-care.

### 7\. A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag.

As an individual activist, it’s important to stay flexible and adaptable in your approach. By being willing to try new tactics and let go of old ones that are no longer working, you can keep your activism fresh and engaging.

Why it’s needed: In a rapidly changing world, the tactics that worked yesterday may not work today. By staying open to new ideas and approaches, individual activists can stay ahead of the curve and avoid getting stuck in a rut.

Example: When the Occupy Wall Street movement began in 2011, it quickly captured the public imagination with its bold critique of economic inequality and its creative use of public space. However, as the movement dragged on without clear demands or leadership, it began to lose momentum and support. Individual activists within the movement had to adapt and find new ways to keep the conversation going.

Bold idea for individual activists: Create a personal “truth experiment” that involves trying a new tactic or approach to your activism every month. Keep a journal of your experiences and reflect on what works and what doesn’t. Share your insights with others and encourage them to experiment as well.

### 8\. Keep the pressure on. Never let up.

As an individual activist, it’s important to stay committed to your cause for the long haul. By maintaining a steady pressure on those in power, you can wear them down over time and force them to make concessions.

Why it’s needed: Those who benefit from the status quo will often try to wait out activists and hope that they will lose steam or get distracted by other issues. By staying focused and persistent, individual activists can show that they are in it for the long haul and will not be ignored.

Example: When Bryan Stevenson founded the Equal Justice Initiative in 1989, he knew that he was taking on a system of mass incarceration and racial injustice that had been entrenched for centuries. But by staying committed to his vision of a more just and equitable society, he has been able to win major victories and inspire a new generation of activists.

Bold idea for individual activists: Create a personal “truth pledge” that commits you to taking one action every day, week, or month to advance your cause. Share your pledge with others and ask them to hold you accountable. Celebrate your progress along the way and use it to inspire others to join you.

### 9\. The threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself.

As an individual activist, you may face threats, intimidation, or retaliation from those who oppose your message. But by refusing to be silenced and continuing to speak your truth, you can inspire others to overcome their own fears and join the fight.

Why it’s needed: Those in power often rely on fear and intimidation to maintain control and silence dissent. By showing courage in the face of threats, individual activists can break the spell of fear and empower others to speak out.

Example: When Malala Yousafzai began advocating for girls’ education in Pakistan, she faced death threats and ultimately a brutal assassination attempt by the Taliban. But by refusing to be silenced and continuing to speak out, she has become a global icon for the power of individual courage and conviction.

Bold idea for individual activists: Create a personal “truth shield” that reminds you of your strength and resilience in the face of threats or intimidation. This could be a physical object, a mantra, or a visualization that you can turn to whenever you feel scared or overwhelmed. Share your truth shield with others and encourage them to create their own.

### 10\. The major premise for manipulating the system is: if you push a negative hard enough, it will push through and become a positive.

As an individual activist, you may need to use confrontational or disruptive tactics to force those in power to confront the urgency of your cause. By creating a crisis or breakdown in the system, you can open up space for real change to occur.

Why it’s needed: Those who benefit from the status quo will often try to ignore or minimize the problems that activists are trying to address. By creating a sense of urgency and crisis, individual activists can force a reckoning and create opportunities for transformation.

Example: When Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus in 1955, she knew that she was risking arrest and retaliation. But by taking a bold stand against the injustice of segregation, she helped spark a citywide bus boycott and a national movement for civil rights.

Bold idea for individual activists: Create a personal “truth crisis” plan that identifies a specific injustice or problem in your community that you want to confront. Brainstorm a list of disruptive tactics that you could use to force those in power to address the issue, and identify allies who could support you in taking action. Be prepared for backlash, but stay focused on your ultimate goal of creating positive change.

### 11\. The end is what you want, the means is how you get there.

As an individual activist, it’s easy to get bogged down in the day-to-day challenges and setbacks of the work. But by staying focused on your ultimate goal and being flexible in your tactics, you can stay motivated and adapt to changing circumstances.

Why it’s needed: Activism is a marathon, not a sprint. By keeping your eyes on the prize and being willing to adjust your strategies along the way, you can maintain your momentum and avoid getting sidetracked by short-term obstacles.

Example: When Mari Copeny, also known as “Little Miss Flint,” began advocating for clean water in her hometown of Flint, Michigan, at the age of 8, she knew that it would be a long and difficult fight. But by staying focused on her ultimate goal of ensuring that every child in Flint had access to safe and affordable drinking water, she has been able to inspire a global movement and secure major investments in infrastructure and public health.

Bold idea for individual activists: Create a personal “truth map” that charts your journey as an activist, from your initial inspiration to your ultimate goal. Identify the key milestones and challenges along the way, and the tactics and strategies you will use to overcome them. Use this map to stay focused and motivated, and to track your progress over time. Share your truth map with others and invite them to create their own.

### Amplifying Our Truths

The Fucked Up Rules lay bare the realities we face as activists fighting against unjust systems designed to preserve oppression and inequality. The odyssey detailed in my ongoing [Truth](https://quniio.wpcomstaging.com/truth/) narrative is a prime example of how institutions meant to protect citizens can fail catastrophically, compounding harm and dehumanization when accountability goes dark.

In such a landscape, our personal stories become the most potent weapons we have. Creating the [TruthAMP app](https://poe.com/TruthAMP) recognizes this power of the individual voice to disrupt dominant narratives and ideologies that prop up broken systems. By helping activists synthesize their struggles into rich, compelling narratives, TruthAMP provides a way to refocus the lens on our lived truths.

The act of crafting and sharing our truths becomes an emancipatory process – exposing the fault lines in the master’s logic, awakening people to realities the powerful work tirelessly to obscure. Every platform we claim to project our voices outward chips away at the illusion of legitimacy unjust systems rely upon. Our stories humanize the demoralizing statistics, put faces to the injustices, and rally people to our causes in a visceral way.

So take up these Fucked Up Rules not with rules set by the enemy, but by unleashing the authentic fire of your own truth. Use tools like TruthAMP to refine that molten essence of your experience into a blade to cut through apathy. Because ultimately, when enough individuals brandishing their truths converge as an inextinguishable force, the masters’ defenses cannot hold. Their deceptions and oppression are exposed as the lies they are, clearing the path to forge new realities of justice and human thriving. Amplify your truth, and the rest will follow.

Remember, the goal is not to become the system, but to be yourself and use your unique skills and perspective to create a better world for all.
