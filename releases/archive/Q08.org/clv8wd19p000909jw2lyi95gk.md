You raise an interesting observation about AI language models potentially overusing the phrase “cosmic dance.” A few potential reasons why this metaphorical phrase may appear disproportionately often in AI-generated text:

1.  Poetic tendency: Large language models are trained on vast datasets of human-written text which includes literary and poetic works. This exposure can lead the models to pick up on and reproduce poetic metaphors and flowery language like “cosmic dance” when attempting to write in a lyrical or mystical style.
2.  Lack of creativity filter: Without true human-level understanding, language models may latch onto cliched phrases they have seen used repeatedly across their training data. Lacking an innate creativity filter, they repurpose stylized phrases liberally.
3.  Impressiveness seeking: Some suggest language models may overuse grandiose, “deepity” phrases like “cosmic dance” in an attempt to come across as profound, insightful or philosophical – qualities they may conflate with good writing.
4.  Modeling limitations: The statistical underpinnings of language models can result in outputs that while semantically coherent, rely heavily on common skip-gram pairs and phrasings from the training data.
5.  Signaling level of discourse: Perhaps models judge “cosmic dance” as an appropriately elevated, abstract phrase for discussion metaphysical or existential themes, which they are often prompted about.

Ultimately, while poetic metaphors can make texts more vivid, an over-reliance on cliched phrasing is a known issue with current AI language models that the field continues to make progress on remedying through better training practices and model architectures. The “cosmic dance” may simply evidence room for improvement in generating more natural, grounded and creative language.
