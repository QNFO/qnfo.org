Recently, while passing through San Francisco, I came across a shop with a sign that read, “A nonprofit visual arts center, where artists with developmental, mental disabilities create, exhibit, and sell art.” Far from questioning the shop’s choice of words, it prompted a profound reflection on how language shapes our perceptions.

In this moment of contemplation, I recalled the term “diff-ability,” a concept that reframes how we perceive developmental abilities. Instead of viewing individuals through the lens of disabilities, diff-ability encourages us to recognize and celebrate the diverse abilities that each person possesses. It’s not about labeling the art shop’s choice of words as incorrect; rather, it’s about exploring alternative perspectives.

The essence of diff-ability lies in acknowledging that we all have different developmental abilities. Individuals with autism, ADHD, or any other unique profile bring a spectrum of strengths and skills. This perspective challenges traditional labels, fostering inclusivity and highlighting the richness that arises from our diverse abilities.

By embracing the language of diff-ability, we move away from limitations and focus on what individuals can contribute. This isn’t merely about being politically correct; it’s a cultural shift that values and harnesses the full spectrum of human abilities.

The nonprofit visual arts center I encountered serves as a tangible example of diff-ability in action. Here, artists with diverse developmental abilities not only create but also exhibit and sell their art. It’s not a matter of correctness; it’s about recognizing the artistic brilliance within these individuals and providing them with a platform to share their talents.

In this reflection on developmental abilities, let’s explore the empowering concept of diff-ability. It’s a language that promotes understanding, inclusivity, and a celebration of the unique gifts that make each individual exceptional. This isn’t about following a trend; it’s about recognizing the potential for a more compassionate and accepting world, where everyone’s abilities are acknowledged and celebrated.
