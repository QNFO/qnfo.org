Our exploration began with gravitational lensing, a phenomenon predicted by Einsteinâ€™s general relativity whereby massive objects like galaxies bend light rays to act as natural cosmic lenses. Iconic examples like Twin Quasars and [Einstein Crosses/Rings](http://How a Complete Einstein Ring, Spotted by the James Webb Space Telescope, Can Reveal Mysteries About Dark Matter and How Ancient Giant Galaxies Formed  https://nautil.us/the-enlightening-beauty-of-an-einstein-ring-500597/) revealed light bending and multiplying into arcs and multiple images. Analyzing these lensing patterns enables mapping the matter distributions in galaxies by reconstructing their gravitational fields. This technique has opened an observational window into the distant, early universe.

In examining gravitational lensing, a potential connection to the physics concept of holography emerged. The multiplicity of images and perspectives seemed reminiscent of how a hologram encodes information on a surface that can recreate a 3D reality. This led us to consider whether the redundant perspectives provided by lensing could demonstrate holographic principles in the real cosmos. Just as the views from intersecting holographic plates can recreate a holographic projection, the multiple lensed images reconstruct the 3D gravitational profile and mass distribution of the lensing galaxy.

Pursing this holographic lead, we explored theoretical frameworks like the holographic principle from string theory, which relates the information content in a volume to encodings on its surface boundary. Quantum error correcting codes were considered for their analogous robust information storage distributed across extensive quantum entanglements, much like hypothetical holographic encodings in the fabric of spacetime. The black hole information paradox also echoed implications that information could be intrinsically woven into cosmic geometry.

Synthesizing these threads, gravitational lensing emerged as potential observational evidence of an informational essence to our physical cosmos, where matter, energy and gravity arise from underlying quantum information encodings on cosmic surfaces. This holographic paradigm suggests a computational basis to our universe, with philosophical implications for the primacy of information over matter. The universe could be seen as a quantum computer where physics emerges from manipulation of elemental information bits.

While much theoretical and experimental work remains, our journey illuminated a web of connections between gravitational lensing, quantum holography and information theory that may profoundly reshape our understanding of the cosmos. The fabric of spacetime itself may be the hardware encoding a cosmic hologram, of which our experiences are but a projection. Ongoing study of gravitational lensing and information physics promises more insights into this informational cosmology.
