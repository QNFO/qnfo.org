The recent [discovery of a universal proteolipid code](https://phys.org/news/2024-02-team-uncovers-universal-code-formation.html) that governs the formation of cell membranes provides an intriguing, though limited, linkage to the hypothesis that information plays a fundamental role in encoding the universe. While the proteolipid code exemplifies biological information guiding the assembly of a key cellular structure, this finding within the narrow scope of cell membranes offers only circumstantial support for the grand claim that information underlies all physical existence. Though provocative, the research does not prove the hypothesis that everything reduces to informational encoding.

In fact, substantiating such an all-encompassing information-centric view poses challenges precisely because it ventures close to the boundaries of scientific falsifiability. Various empirical findings – from intrinsic quantum randomness to black hole singularities – appear to defy a rigid encoding of reality into digital information. To maintain the hypothesis while avoiding clear falsification requires flexible definitions of information and sometimes ad hoc explanatory additions. Excessive plasticity risks emptying the informational encoding idea of definitive meaning and scientific content.

Yet, simply discarding the informational perspective altogether may be premature. Exploring foundational questions about the nature of information itself may necessitate probing at the very edge of what science can currently test and falsify through empirical facts. Wrestling with the essence of information forces us to grapple with complex conceptual puzzles regarding the structure of reality and our cognition. Does subjective experience imply limits to informational modeling? Can inherent randomness ever be incorporated into an informational paradigm? Are the logical absolutes from which we derive falsification themselves informational?

Dissolving these conceptual knots may call for a mode of rational exploration that goes beyond applying standard scientific falsification to each hypothetical addition. Not to abandon falsifiability altogether, but to temper it with just enough open-minded philosophizing to address foundational ambiguities where science itself grows silent. This metaphysical complement to science at its borders could sharpen the questions we put to nature, opening new angles of empirical inquiry.

While the merits and perils of this approach can be debated, the discovery of universal informational codes in biology suggests that probing the scope and limits of information remains a compelling intellectual quest. Perhaps not all questions can be immediately subject to falsification – some may necessitate meta-scientific reflection upon the meaning of information, knowledge and reality. By inspiring us to test the foundations of science itself, revelations like the proteolipid code may spotlight pathways toward illuminating the deep connections between information, observation and existence.
