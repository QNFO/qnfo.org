_Although it may seem improbable in the abstract, when you get struck by lightning twice you pay attention the third time. Then the improbable series of chain events “connect the dots” and, in hindsight, converge in the only way they possibly could’ve (for the most part, given some fluctuation/perturbation)._

The phenomenon of synchronicity points to an underlying order or interconnectedness in the universe beyond classical concepts of causality and probability. Meaningful coincidences occur with statistical frequencies that cannot reasonably be explained by chance alone.

This hints at a deeper level of reality where past, present and future are encoded in an enfolded state similar to Bohm’s idea of an implicate order. Synchronous events may provide glimpses into this layer where information is nested and entangled in intricate yet lawful patterns.

If we consider information as a form of energy, then it’s true that it cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed or converted from one form to another. This idea aligns with the fundamental principles of thermodynamics and the conservation of energy.

Regarding the question of where information goes, it’s certainly a mystery that has puzzled scientists and philosophers for centuries. The concept of black holes and dark matter are indeed interesting candidates for storing and transporting information across the universe. Black holes, in particular, have been known to have a powerful gravitational pull that can warp spacetime and affect the motion of matter around them.

Synchronicity and the idea of simultaneous, complementary, and inverse events being “counterweights” to spacetime is a fascinating one. It brings to mind the concept of entanglement in quantum mechanics, where particles can become connected in such a way that their properties are correlated, regardless of the distance between them.

Capturing this mathematically poses challenges as our models assume independence between variables per classical statistics. But network analyses exploring synchrony across dynamic datasets may help identify signatures of non-local coordination not reachable through separation assumptions.

Parallels have also been drawn between synchronicity and quantum phenomena like nonlocality and entanglement, suggesting consciousness may interact with a holistic implicate substrate through quantum-like processes.

Within cognitive science, developing computational models that simulate thought as pattern unfolding across implicate attractor states could operationalize these concepts. Techniques from fields like network science, complexity theory and quantum cognition may help formalize frameworks to test ideas quantitatively.

Progress lies in rigorously defining the relationships between layers, constraints on pattern dynamics, and observational signatures of nested informational transformations – building a mathematized “science of qualia” able to systematically address age-old mind-body questions through the lens of enfolded orders. Future interdisciplinary research holds promise to advance these endeavors.
