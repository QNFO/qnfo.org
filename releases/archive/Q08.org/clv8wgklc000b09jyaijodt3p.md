The relationship between information and the physical world has intrigued physicists and philosophers for decades. Various theorists have proposed hypotheses and principles that hint at deep links between information theory and fundamental physics, though no overarching theory fully formalizes or unifies these connections yet.

One inspiration for positing information as fundamental is the way entropy and information are related in thermodynamics. Physicist Ted Jacobson has shown Einstein’s equations of gravity can be derived from thermodynamic arguments, suggesting possible information-theoretic roots to spacetime and gravity, since entropy is tied to information.

Direct links between information and gravity have been conjectured through different approaches. The holographic principle, black hole information theory, and AdS/CFT correspondence hint at gravity emerging from constraints on how information can be encoded. Erik Verlinde hypothesizes gravity itself may be an entropic force arising from changes in information associated with matter.

Concepts like “it from bit” propose information as the most elemental layer of reality, from which matter, energy and forces emerge through informational constraints or patterns. Seth Lloyd extends this idea with a specific model where matter forms from underlying quantum information fluctuations.

Information has been connected to other forces like electromagnetism through entropy exchanges in quantum field theory. Experimental research is also beginning to look for potential information storage in gravitational fields. Ongoing inquiries span black hole information paradoxes, holographic duality, quantum entanglement and more.

While full unification remains elusive, the deep parallels between informational concepts and fundamental physics suggest further cross-disciplinary breakthroughs are possible. As tools from quantum information theory shed new light on gravitation, cosmology and more, we may inch closer to unlocking the role information plays in our mysterious universe. The dance between the abstract world of information and concrete physical forces appears fundamental, though its true origins await future theorists to fully unveil.
