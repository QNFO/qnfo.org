I used to think I was lazy, that I didn’t like to write or couldn’t pay attention long enough to code even though I got my professional start learning what was at the time out-of-date Fortran computer simulation network models of transportation.

and then I realized I wasn’t thinking deep enough. Fast forward to today my brain still processes about the same amount of information, but it seems like I can focus incredible array of lasers in effective directions. And that’s a conversation for another day, suffice it to say my latest realization is we’ve got operating systems and software all wrong. We’ve been trained to see the technical limitations in how we interact with things meaning we believe that phones have to have screens and that we should even have to think about the Internet going down.

Get where I’m going here? Let me cut to the chase I just realize or rather the latest evolution of my thinking about why we have software all wrong came to me when I asked a query of my LLM OS:

`Simulate fixing broken systems generally. What would that look like?`

And…before I lose you with the verbatim response below, let me say that I know I’m onto something and surely some of you out there in coder land will pop your heads up from whatever the fuck language is these days because it really doesn’t matter and see the potential so hit me up.

`Certainly! Let's explore the concept of fixing broken systems in a general sense. We'll approach this by expanding the idea, identifying relevant entities, forming meaningful sets, performing analyses, and generating insights. Here's a comprehensive plan.`

OK, cool since you actually did read through all that then here’s what I’m wondering: reverse engineer my code because I could give it to you, but what’s more interesting is how it’s disseminated and make the knowledge and the truly ineffable information it contains available to everyone.
