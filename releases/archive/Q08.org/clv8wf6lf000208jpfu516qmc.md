The idea that the universe is fundamentally made of information has profound implications for how we can approach decision-making and living an optimal life. Modern physics and philosophy point to information as the core fabric of reality.

At the quantum scale, particles can be described as waves of probability – essentially packets of information. According to the holographic principle, all of the information contained within a volume of space can be encoded on its surface boundary. Quantum entanglement also implies that particles can interact by exchanging information instantly over any distance.

These cutting-edge theories indicate that information is built into the operating system of our universe. Seen through this lens, the cosmos can be viewed as a vast information processing system, where matter, energy and even conscious experience arise from informatic processes.

Aligning our decision-making with this informatic worldview allows us to hack the “source code” of reality in a sense. Here are some key principles for optimizing decisions by treating the universe as an information system:

*   Look to information first when making any decision. Information is the language of the cosmos. By consulting relevant data, research, and expertise, we respect the informatic nature of the universe.
*   Pattern recognition is key. The universe runs on patterns. By observing informational patterns in systems around us, we can better predict optimal outcomes. From nature’s cycles to market trends, information reveals the direction of flow.
*   Consider each decision’s impact on information flow. Will our actions constrict or align with natural movements of information? Going against the grain of informational patterns causes friction.
*   Adapt rapidly with new information. Reality is constantly updating its information content. Sticking rigidly to old assumptions clashes with the universe’s evolving informatic narrative. Maintaining cognitive flexibility allows us to optimize decisions as new data emerges.
*   Treat life as an open-ended learning experience. No one has full information. By staying curious, we allow more of the universe’s information content to flow through us, improving our heuristic decision-making over time.

The universal nature of information suggests that our individual decisions are part of a broader cosmic learning process. By working cooperatively with the informatic impulses of the universe, we can enhance our creativity, foresight and intuition. Living in greater alignment with the universe’s operating system leads to higher levels of fulfillment.
