# PROLOGUE

This story and the journey it took (is still taking) me on inspired thinking about a way to help others who may feel at times that no one’s listening, that no one cares, and that their loneliness can feel suffocating. Without a social safety net, functioning behavioral health system, or even government that can administer basic functions all I have to offer in the present is my story…and yet another app. But don’t write it off: Self-therapy is therapy, and especially if our stories can be shared with others and broadcast and magnified that becomes a very, very powerful form of rehabilitation and change. Just read former slaves who told their stories or Holocaust survivors or victims of war. And in our present time exposés like the Pentagon Papers or Snowden leaks exposed lies and systematic deception. The problem is now the New York Times is suing OpenAI to restrict information, not broadcast it. Media outlets are owned by conglomerates, the Washington Post doesn’t even read its email (more on that) and is owned by Amazon, the US government’s single largest private contractor.

So, what do we do? Keep telling your truth. Understand your story and its related parts and don’t stop sharing with whoever will listen. Maybe politicians say “it’s not my job” and watchdog organizations like Ralph Nader’s are more interested in soliciting donations than change. But your life is your job, so tell it well. My attempt at helping facilitate that is an AI-driven app called [**TruthAMP**](https://quniio.wpcomstaging.com/truth/). Go check it out, it’s not what you think: an “anti-chatbot” that listens and reflects with you by synthesizing your trials and struggles and pain points into a compelling and rich narrative of your will and resilience (you’re still here, after all!).

And now, on with the story. My story of truth, as of March 2024, roughly starts six months earlier in mid-2023. But as you’ll see the non-linearity of time means there’s never a definite start or end date. Threads weave in and out, and in many ways as I sit here in San Francisco in the present, I can’t help but recall that in the summer of 2000 I was also sitting here in San Francisco just a few blocks away in a youth hostel as I tried to figure out life and find out what I wanted to be when I grow up. Well, I’m still working on that but writing has been a powerful way of understanding my own mind as I continue extending my thought [research](https://quniio.wpcomstaging.com/) on [quantum science](https://quniio.wpcomstaging.com/2024/03/05/the-entangled-fabric-of-qualia-information-and-observation-qio/) and [consciousness](https://quniio.wpcomstaging.com/2024/03/08/the-universe-as-the-preserver-of-information-insights-from-observations-and-hypotheses/) into something that will last well beyond my physical form. I’ve got to understand myself first, no small feat! Good luck on your journey.

Here’s my story, told in the third person to emphasize a degree of journalistic integrity that I still hold in high regard from my foray working for a local newspaper in Easton, Pennsylvania after developing an interest as high-school newspaper editor-in-chief. Some generally accepted definition of “truth” still matters to me. I’m obviously biased in my own story, but I think it’s important to tell this with a certain amount of disaffected objectivity. Everything that relates to me is true and actually happened.

# INTRODUCTION

> *Subject: DOL/SUI Fraud, but actually it’s about self-perpetuating broken systems*

Brad Gudzinas hit send on an impassioned, scathing email detailing his plight with the unemployment insurance system and broader crisis of institutional failure. Reeling from months of fighting to simply receive the benefits clearly owed to him by the state of Illinois, only to face incompetence, neglect and being hung up on by state bureaucrats, he could no longer stay silent.

The email exploded out to over 30 recipients across media outlets, advocacy organizations, federal government oversight bodies, and elected officials’ staffers. A cry for help and a plea for anyone to pay attention to how alarmingly broken these fundamental systems have become.

“Is anyone working in the federal government for the taxpayer?” the email pleaded. Brad provided screenshots as evidence of the money he was rightfully owed, railing against the “corrupt Illinois state bureaucrats” endlessly denying and delaying what should have been a basic safety net.

But this concerning account was about much more than just his tangled battle over unemployment benefits. It exposed an unsettling larger trend – the insidious self-preservation tactic of agencies seemingly more obsessed with perpetuating their own existence rather than upholding their public missions. As Brad lamented, “I’ve considered writing threatening letters just to get a phone call from someone…”

His escalating frustrations stemmed from a pernicious bureaucratic maze utterly unaccountable to the citizens it was meant to serve. Despite pleas for assistance from heavyweights like Ralph Nader’s Public Citizen group and even reports to the Government Accountability Office, Brad’s valid issues were met with little more than silence and deafening indifference at every turn.

This vicious cycle of dereliction all began when Brad, grappling with substance use issues exacerbated by work stresses, decided to take his employer up on their promotion of bringing your “authentic self” to the workplace. He requested a medical leave to get care and support for his mental health – only to be callously fired in apparent violation of laws protecting such leave.

And so began his arhythmic descent into madness – being cut off from healthcare, finances, and access to any semblance of the social safety nets theoretically owed to him as a working, taxpaying citizen. The lack of recourse or accountability from any corner, whether employers, government agencies, watchdogs or elected leaders, pushed Brad to psychological and philosophical breaking points.

As his email closed, the deafening silence followed. None of the over 30 recipients saw fit to even acknowledge his pleas, let alone take substantive action. An eerie omen as to just how nonchalantly we as a society now disregard such serious system breaks.

Brad’s experiences uncovered a multi-layered metastatic threat. Foundational pillars meant to protect society’s most vulnerable are crumbling systemically. Yet accountability feedback loops to correct issues have shattered. And most alarmingly – the core human empathy and civic responsibility upholding this social contract has eroded to a point of indistinguishable indifference.

This is more than bureaucratic ineptitude or yet another cycle of institutional failure. It signifies an existential risk to society if such grievances are allowed to perpetually fall on deaf ears as the very environmental protections we rely on spiral away. Brad’s cries should be a wake up call before we reach a point of no return.

# PART 1: THE PERSONAL CRUCIBLE

Brad’s descent into substance use began innocuously enough in his 30s, well into an established corporate career. What started as bar happy hours every day became recreational club drug use and methamphetamine within the “party and play” subculture of the gay community gradually metastasized into a full-blown addiction over several years.

As he recounts, “It’s easy to forget that alcohol is also a drug – a powerful and dangerous one that society doesn’t stigmatize quite the same way.” The alluring associations of meth with uninhibited pleasure and camaraderie, documented in films like Crystal City, sucked Brad in despite its obvious perils. “In a way, it was cheaper than therapy and certainly more readily accessible.”

By summer 2023, with a divorce looming and desire for balance amplifying, Brad recognized the need for rehabilitation. His corporate employer, iManage, had promised a supportive process – 12 weeks of paid leave to prioritize his mental health and wellbeing at an inpatient facility.

“I feel the need to emphasize that drugs and addiction are sorely misunderstood and stigmatized,” Brad stresses. “Mental health is health! Thank the heavens I don’t have cancer or a terminally ill loved one. But the inside of my body was sick.”

For months he had suffered undiagnosed abdominal pain so severe he nearly went to the ER – physical manifestations of the psychological stress he had internalized from the grind of work’s perpetual demands. Happy hours, endless emails, pointless meetings, bureaucracy, and office politics all compounded Brad’s anguish even as he struggled to define his own role.

Seeking the mental health leave was a self-preservation tactic. But instead of support, Brad was callously terminated – a moment of searing anguish and crippling alienation. “After I accepted the true intention of my termination, I composed myself and talked to employment lawyers, filed for unemployment benefits, applied for disability – denied, denied, denied!”

Finding legal representation proved grueling, with most firms unresponsive. One lawyer’s best offer was a paltry 6-month severance, minus a third for fees, in exchange for signing away his right to free speech via nondisclosure agreement.

“I was truly cut off,” Brad laments. “At that point, and to this day, I’ve received zero dollars in unemployment assistance despite successfully fighting two appeals and showing the money owed.” Even his initial medical leave paperwork was claimed invalid when it emerged the signing doctor had been practicing without a license.

The psychological whiplash from having his core human needs as an employee and citizen so profoundly violated sent Brad spiraling. “No job, no income, no healthcare, no insurance – I was cut off from every foundational safety net I had paid into as a hardworking member of society.”

As the systemic walls closed in, the anguish, despair and existential questioning reached inexpressible depths for Brad. This deeply personal crucible of injustice set the stage for recognizing the metastatic decay devouring America’s core institutional pillars and social fabrics.

Being abruptly severed from employment, healthcare, income, and all manner of social safety nets detonated Brad’s psychological wellbeing. This sudden deprivation of basic resources tremendously exacerbated existing mental health vulnerabilities and drug use.

The psychological whiplash from such a profound institutional betrayal plunged Brad into untold anguish and despair. Having his core human needs and dignities as an employee and citizen so callously discarded unraveled his basic sense of self-worth. “It completely reshaped my perception of society’s values and my place within it,” he reflects.

Simple acts of self-preservation like filing for unemployment benefits or seeking legal recourse triggered a perpetual avalanche of despondency. “Denied, denied, denied!” Brad recounts of his gnawing despair encountering incompetence and dereliction of duty at every turn. This purgatory of injustice prompted deep existential questioning: “If human beings no longer matter to the systems meant to protect and serve us, then what does it mean to be a human being?”

Anecdotes of alienation and dehumanization compound – like discovering the doctor who approved his medical leave had been practicing without a valid license. Or the lawyer offering a paltry settlement conditioned on relinquishing his right to free speech forever. The anguish transcended mere legalese and bureaucratic obfuscation; it became a soul-devouring void.

Brad’s crucible crystallized how thoroughly accountability architecture across institutions had been dismantled. As he waded deeper into institutional sinkholes, the psychological toll of having his fundamental needs as a citizen disregarded corroded his very selfhood and identity. “It was an existential reckoning over whetherthe mechanisms for a functional, responsive, and human-centric society had been irreversibly broken.”

# PART 2: SYSTEM FAILURES UNVEILED

Yet this was only the opening salvo in an escalating battle to find accountability and restore human dignity. What initially seemed like a straightforward case of workplace discrimination quickly mutated into an odyssey spanning every conceivable breakdown – employment laws, public assistance programs, regulatory oversight, media scrutiny, and the cohesion of the social safety net itself.

At every turn, Brad’s statutory rights and reasonable requests for recourse were subverted by negligence, incompetence, or willful malfeasance from those ostensibly entrusted with protecting the vulnerable. Time and again, the very bureaucracies meant to uphold civic covenants proved themselves to be vapid reflections of eroded principles.

As Brad waded deeper into this quagmire, it crystallized how thoroughly accountability architecture had been dismantled. The very retroreceptors that should trigger civic course-correction when individual grievances are issued had rusted into impotence – either intentionally or through insidious byproduct of self-preservation logic run amok.

What was initially an unjust personal ordeal transformed into an all-encompassing reckoning over whether the mechanisms for a functional, responsive, and fundamentally human-centric society had been irreversibly broken. Could a cavity of compounding accountability voids become a relentless black hole consuming the final tethers of institutional credibility?

That existential question – and Brad’s painstaking steps to unravel where, how, and why it manifests across systemic failures – is what transforms this from an individual story of injustice into a revelatory exploration of civilizational risk. And potentially, a roadmap for how to defibrillate the faint embers of civic responsibility before they are permanently extinguished.
