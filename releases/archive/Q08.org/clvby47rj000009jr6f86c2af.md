It is the interconnectedness of information across multiple dimensions, limitless possibilities as we consider our own existence.

## What’s the backstory of Q8?

Q8 is a testament to the power of embracing one's identity, exploring diverse ways of understanding the world, and building communities that celebrate both unity and diversity. It is a journey of self-discovery, scientific inquiry, and creative expression, all encapsulated in the enigmatic Q and the infinite 8.

## What inspired the creation of Q8 and [Q08.org](http://Q08.org)?

The creation of Q8 and [Q08.org](http://Q08.org) was inspired by Rowan's journey as a queer individual navigating an increasingly fragmented world. The quest for unity amidst diversity and the desire to build a community that celebrates both led Rowan to explore various facets of identity, science, and personal experiences.

## Why the letter Q?

The letter "Q" fascinates due to its peculiar shape and unique phonetics in the English language. It became a symbol of Rowan's queer identity, association with a larger Q’munity. As Rowan delved into quantum physics, "Q" also began to represent the strange and counterintuitive principles of quantum mechanics, resonating with their personal identity. Thus, "Q" became a bridge between Rowan's identity and scientific interests.

## What’s significant about 8?

The numeral 8 is significant to Rowan because it corresponds to their birthday, August 8, or "08." This date symbolizes new beginnings and cultural shifts, as it is a week after the launch of MTV. Over time, Rowan embraced the infinite significance of "08," which resembles the symbol of infinity and represents boundless potential, interconnectedness with 8 billion people, and the uroboric cycle of creation and destruction.

## How did Rowan's skepticism toward numerology evolve?

For much of their life, Rowan was skeptical of numerology and other non-scientific ways of understanding existence. This skepticism was a reflection of their own ignorance rather than the universe's complexities. Eventually, Rowan realized that embracing their complete identity allowed them to reconcile their scientific rigor with a more holistic understanding of existence.

## What does Q8 symbolize?

Q8 symbolizes convergence and the infinite potential of life. Together, Q8 embodies the power to "equate" and "create," balancing unity and diversity, and fostering a community that celebrates both.

## How does Rowan's astrological sign, Leo, influence their journey?

As a Leo, Rowan's journey is influenced by traits such as strength, creativity, and leadership. These traits guided Rowan in building [Q08.org](http://Q08.org) and championing the causes they believe in. Their destiny, shaped by both the stars and personal experiences, led Rowan to create a space where science, identity, and community intersect meaningfully.

## What is the purpose of [Q08.org](http://Q08.org)?

[Q08.org](http://Q08.org) explores and celebrates the diverse facets of identity, science, and community. It aims to balance unity and diversity, fostering a community that appreciates both. The website serves as a space for self-discovery, scientific inquiry, and creative expression.
