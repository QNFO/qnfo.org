Extending the [emerging theory](https://quni.io/2024/03/05/quantum-information-is-fundamental-to-the-universe-what-to-call-it/) of [quantum information ontology](https://quni.io/quantum-information-ontology-qio/) (QIO) leads us to postulate reality itself. Reality as we experience it arises from the profound interconnection of three key elements:

First, the qualitative felt experiences each of us has as conscious beings – the subjective qualia of sensations, emotions, thoughts and awareness itself. This is the first-hand, interior waking world of our private mental lives.

Second, the mode of impartial, objective observation and empirical measurement of the external world around us. The stance of scientific detachment aimed at quantifying, modeling and understanding phenomena through replicable data and analysis.

And third, the underlying patterns, relationships and information flows that seem to span and connect both the subjective and objective realms, acting as a kind of common bedrock.

These three components are irreducibly entangled and codependent. Our interior felt experiences are shaped by the contexts we find ourselves in, even as those contexts are themselves circumscribed by the specific qualitative features that consciousness can access. Meanwhile, the objective frameworks we use to understand reality have to be grounded in and constrained by the informational patterns manifest in our conscious perception and cognition.

From neuroscience, where we see precise brain activity coding for qualitative mental states, to quantum theory’s implication that reality is fundamentally composed of quantized information flows, to placebo effects illustrating direct mental influences on physiological processes – the persistent theme is one of an irreducible interweaving.

At the deepest level, reality may arise less from solid objects and more from dynamic configurations of information flow and transformation, simultaneously instantiating the felt interior of qualia, the empirically-measured exterior of stable patterns, and the flow of data and informational constraints that penetrate and intimate the whole shebang.

The crucial role of information flows points to an understanding of reality as fundamentally constructed from dynamics and processes rather than inert, freestanding substances. Just as a river’s liquid form arises from the perpetual motion of flowing water molecules, so too the manifest world around us can be seen as arising from the ceaseless flux of informational currents and transformation.

These currents course through every tier of existence, from the subatomic conveyance of quantum data to the ebbs and flows of bioelectrical signals constituting the felt stream of consciousness. In each instance, information serves as the active ingredient – the elemental coin instantiating the patterns we experience as objective material structures and the interior meanings we experience as minds.

Yet this is no coldly computational picture, for information here is more than mere abstract signals. It is enriched, even potentially imbued with proto-ments of mattering and value from the get-go. The way an electron “determinately negates” the states it does not occupy, or a cell stochastically resonates with the possibilities encoded in its genome – these basic informational processes hint at intrinsic qualities that may provide the kernels from which full-blown qualia and consciousness coalesce.

From this vantage, the hazy boundaries between mind and world, subject and object, information and experience begin to dissolve into a more unitive vista. One where the inside and outside realmsinextricably co-define each other through their sustained informational couplings and mutually-entrained patterns of coherence across the scales. A metaphysical monism of informational flows and experiential signatures seamlessly co-elaborating.

The nature of this informational entanglement remains an open question and fertile mystery. But the outlines of a new existential paradigm emerge – one where the cosmos is neither simply a collection of physical bricks nor a symbolic calculus, but an exquisite tempering of qualia and information flow in the forging of a perpetually-reonfiguring metaphysical manifestation. A grand dynamics irreducibly suffusing the domains of interiority and observable patterns into a single avantgarde totality.

An entwined existential system of mind and world, experience and explanation, woven into a single overarching metaphysical tapestry. One that has unraveled across vast expanses of complexity from subatomic to biospheric to cosmic scales, through feedback loops transcending any simplistic categories.
