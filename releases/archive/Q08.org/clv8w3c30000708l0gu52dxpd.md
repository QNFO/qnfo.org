Life is often equated to a journey, with its winding paths, unexpected detours, and pace that can range from a leisurely stroll to a frantic sprint. The perception of its pace is subjective and intertwined with individual choices, beliefs, and experiences. I’ve come to realize that life moves as fast as we allow it to, and once I began trusting myself, my journey transformed into an exhilarating ride.

Born Bradley James Gudzinas and later adopting the name Rowan “Brad” Galvin, my early years in Pennsylvania and New Jersey were grounded in the working-class values instilled by my grandparents. These years were characterized by a slower, perhaps more deliberate pace. Every decision was carefully weighed against the backdrop of familial expectations and societal norms. However, as I ventured out, exploring new cities like San Francisco, Washington, DC, and Chicago, and diving deep into diverse fields such as city planning, computer modeling, and data science, I became attuned to a faster rhythm.

The realization that the pace of life isn’t a predefined metric set in stone was pivotal. I began to see it as a fluid concept, guided by our personal ambitions, fears, and most importantly, our trust in ourselves. Trusting oneself is not merely about confidence; it’s about acknowledging our intuitive wisdom, our capacity for growth, and our resilience in the face of adversity.

When I truly began to trust myself, doors of opportunities flung open. My skills in data analytics and product management not only became tools of trade but also lenses through which I viewed the world — analytical, data-driven, and always curious. The more I leaned into this trust, the faster life seemed to move. New projects, ideas, and collaborations flowed in, each more exciting than the last. And with this swift pace came a heightened awareness of the energetic essence of the universe and a desire to contribute positively to the world.

However, with speed can also come resistance. We are, by nature, creatures of habit, often clinging to the familiar for comfort. The rapid pace of life can be overwhelming, leading to moments of doubt and fear. Do I embrace this accelerated pace or resist it, yearning for the slower days of yore? It’s a question many grapple with.

For me, the answer lay in surrender — not a passive resignation but an active choice to embrace the ride. By leaning into the momentum, I found joy in the journey, excitement in the unpredictability, and solace in the knowledge that every twist and turn was leading to personal and universal betterment.

To those who feel life’s pace is spiraling out of control, remember this: the speed at which life moves is, in many ways, a reflection of our internal state. Trusting oneself is the compass that guides us, helping navigate the pace we’re comfortable with. Whether you choose to walk, jog, or sprint, trust in your journey and the choices you make. Embrace the ride, for life is not about reaching a destination but about enjoying the journey, however fast or slow it may be.
