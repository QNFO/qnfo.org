## 1\. Introduction to the idea

The concept of dark matter has long been a topic of interest and research in the scientific community. However, the traditional understanding of dark matter as an unknown particle or entity may be limited. This section introduces the idea that dark matter could be connected to other branches of reality or be the physical manifestation of information underlying matter.

### 1.1. Challenging our current understanding of dark matter

The current understanding of dark matter is based on its gravitational effects on visible matter. However, this understanding is incomplete, and the nature of dark matter remains a mystery. Challenging this understanding, we can explore alternative explanations that may provide a more comprehensive understanding of dark matter.

### 1.2. Inviting alternative explanations for dark matter

Alternative explanations for dark matter can include connections to other branches of reality, such as the multiverse, or the physical manifestation of information underlying matter. These explanations can provide a new perspective on the nature of dark matter and its role in the universe.

## 2\. The concept of the multiverse and its relation to dark matter

The multiverse hypothesis suggests that there are an infinite number of universes beyond our own, each with its own unique properties and laws of physics. This section explores the concept of the multiverse and its potential relation to dark matter.

### 2.1. Dark matter as a manifestation of gravitational effects from other universes

One possibility is that dark matter is not a particle or entity within our universe but rather a manifestation of gravitational effects from other universes. This idea is supported by research suggesting that tiny black holes from the early universe could contain "baby universes" and explain dark matter.

### 2.2. The "many-worlds" interpretation of quantum mechanics

The "many-worlds" interpretation of quantum mechanics suggests that <mark>every time a quantum event occurs, the universe splits into multiple parallel universes</mark>, each with a different outcome. This idea can be related to dark matter, as it may be a manifestation of the gravitational effects of these parallel universes.

## 3\. Information as a physical entity: "it from bit"

The concept of "it from bit" suggests that information is a fundamental aspect of the universe, with physical mass and energy. This section explores the idea that information could be the underlying reality of dark matter.

### 3.1. Information as a fundamental aspect of the universe with physical mass

Information can be considered a fundamental aspect of the universe, with physical mass and energy. This idea challenges the traditional understanding of matter and energy as the building blocks of the universe.

### 3.2. Dark matter as the physical manifestation of information underlying matter

Dark matter could be the physical manifestation of information underlying matter, providing a new perspective on its nature and role in the universe.

## 4\. The concept of infotons: Mass of information as dark matter

Infotons are hypothetical particles that represent the mass of information. This section explores the concept of infotons and their potential relation to dark matter.

### 4.1. Infotons as non-spatial entities with mass

Infotons can be considered non-spatial (non-physical?} entities with mass, providing a new understanding of the nature of dark matter.

### 4.2. Infotons as the blueprints of the physical universe

Infotons could be the blueprints of the physical universe, providing the underlying structure and organization of matter and energy.

### 4.3. Implications of infotons on our understanding of dark matter

The concept of infotons has significant implications for our understanding of dark matter, providing a new perspective on its nature and role in the universe.

## 5\. Counterarguments and limitations

While the ideas presented in this section are intriguing, there are also counterarguments and limitations to consider.

### 5.1. Speculative nature of the multiverse theory

The multiverse theory is still highly speculative, and there is currently no empirical evidence to support it.

### 5.2. Questions about the interaction of information with matter and energy

There are still many questions about how information interacts with matter and energy, and how this interaction could give rise to dark matter.

### 5.3. Challenges in observing and measuring infotons

Infotons are hypothetical particles, and there are significant challenges in observing and measuring them Here is the continuation of the narrative text:

## 4\. The concept of infotons: Mass of information as dark matter

The concept of infotons suggests that information has mass and can be considered a form of dark matter. This idea is based on the notion that information is a fundamental aspect of the universe, with physical mass and energy.

### 4.1. Infotons as non-spatial, non-physical entities with mass

Infotons can be considered non-spatial, non-physical entities with mass, providing a new understanding of the nature of dark matter. This idea challenges the traditional understanding of matter and energy as the building blocks of the universe.

### 4.2. Infotons as the blueprints of the physical universe

Infotons could be the blueprints of the physical universe, providing the underlying structure and organization of matter and energy. This idea has significant implications for our understanding of the universe and the laws of physics.

### 4.3. Implications of infotons on our understanding of dark matter

The concept of infotons has significant implications for our understanding of dark matter, providing a new perspective on its nature and role in the universe. If infotons are indeed a form of dark matter, it could revolutionize our understanding of the universe and the laws of physics.

## 5\. Counterarguments and limitations

While the ideas presented in this section are intriguing, there are also counterarguments and limitations to consider.

### 5.1. Speculative nature of the multiverse theory

The multiverse theory is still highly speculative, and there is currently no empirical evidence to support it. This lack of evidence makes it challenging to test and validate the theory.

### 5.2. Questions about the interaction of information with matter and energy

There are still many questions about how information interacts with matter and energy, and how this interaction could give rise to dark matter. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying this interaction.

### 5.3. Challenges in observing and measuring infotons

Infotons are hypothetical particles, and there are significant challenges in observing and measuring them. Developing new methods and technologies will be necessary to detect and study infotons.

## 6\. Pushing the idea further: Questions and implications

This section explores the implications of the ideas presented and raises further questions to consider.

### 6.1. How might dark matter properties change if related to infotons?

If dark matter is related to the conceptual infoton, its properties may change significantly. For example, dark matter may no longer be considered a particle or entity within our universe but rather a manifestation of gravitational effects from other universes.

### 6.2. Experimental or observational evidence to support or refute alternative explanations

Experimental or observational evidence is needed to support or refute alternative explanations for dark matter. This evidence could come from searches for signatures of other universes in the cosmic microwave background radiation or from observations of dark matter particles.

### 6.3. Implications for our understanding of reality and the laws of physics

The implications of dark matter being related to non-spatial but nonetheless massive infotons are far-reaching and could revolutionize our understanding of reality and the laws of physics. It could also lead to a deeper understanding of the nature of information and its role in the universe.
