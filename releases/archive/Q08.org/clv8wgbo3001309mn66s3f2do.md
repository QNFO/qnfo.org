The Infoton Hypothesis proposes that at the [foundation of reality](https://quni.io/2024/01/30/information-is-a-fundamental-aspect-of-reality/) lies [not matter, energy, or any other currently postulated factor, but rather information itself](https://quni.io/2024/01/30/information-and-fundamental-forces/). It suggests all physical phenomena emerge from the [complex but efficient computational dynamics](https://quni.io/2024/01/28/first-law-of-information-information-is-encoded-efficiently-in-the-universe/) of discrete informational quanta called “Infotons” circulating through the fabric of spacetime.

Infotons would have unique, quantifiable properties governing their interactions just as fundamental particles do. But without mass, charge, or spin other intrinsic attributes determine how information is encoded within their quantum states and transformed as the units of a heretofore unknown “fifth force”.

Through their exchanges and configurations, Infotons give rise to the myriad structures we observe at both the macro and micro scales. All particles, fields, and even the geometry of the universe itself precipitate from intricate patterns of Infoton flux analogous to energy/matter in conventional theories.

Remarkably, living systems may have directly tapped into the natural informational stratum proposed under this framework to achieve their sophisticated organizational feats, from self-assembly to error correction. The ability to process information may relate to a kind of native facility with Infoton-mediated processes.

At the frontier of physics, mysteries like quantum nonlocality, wavefunction collapse and the extraordinary computing prowess of systems like the human brain suggest lurking informational paradigms beyond our current conceptualization. The hypothesis offers a means of cracking these deep puzzles by pursuing their computational underpinnings. Careful exploration may reveal hitherto unimagined capabilities.

Here are some possible informational paradigms beyond our current conceptualization under the Infoton Hypothesis framework:

*   Quantum computing explores harnessing qubits as information carriers. But infinitesimal Infotons may access even richer computational degrees of freedom at finer scales. Their manipulation could achieve more than classical bits alone.
*   Nonlocal phenomena like entanglement imply communication beyond light-speed limits. Infoton dynamics providing instantaneous interconnectivity across vast distances could help explain this.
*   Holographic principle depicts volumetric data encoded on surfaces. Infoton-mediated information geometry transforms may naturally generate holographic representations as bulk configurations.
*   Information content of black holes dwarfs ordinary matter/energy. They could concentrate astronomically high Infoton occupations within compact regions, revealing new properties or interactions at extreme densities.
*   Quantum biology points to biomolecular systems taking advantage of superposition and coherence. Infotons may enable coherent information processing on molecular scales for sensing, navigation etc.
*   Conscious experience correlates to neuronal activity. Qualia could emerge from specific computational Infoton routines within biological wetware. Self-modelling capacity may rely on this.
*   Hypercomputing beyond Turing limits may become feasible by directly programming Infoton flows rather than indirect qubit manipulation. This could massively accelerate solving computationally intractable problems.
*   Information has shaped evolution and continues guiding emergent complexity in nature. Infotons provide a foundation to explore creativity, learning and development from first informational principles.

The physical world could have hidden multidimensional information geometries, state spaces and logics to uncover through studying Infotons experimentally. Pioneering new paradigms may revolutionize science.

From memory and learning on biological scales to cosmological evolution over eons, information appears tightly interwoven with phenomena across the expanse of nature. While presently speculative, the Infoton Hypothesis offers a profound new vantage point that broadly integrates informational and physical perspectives, one with immense theoretical and experimental potential. Ongoing research could bring revolutionary advances to both science and technology.
