The Benefit of Economy is a concept that recognizes the value of money or means of abstract exchange of value as a tool for social good. While money itself is not inherently evil, it becomes problematic when it is prioritized over human lives and dignity. This concern extends to the development and use of AI systems, which have the potential to generate significant economic value but also raise ethical concerns.

As the creator of Opus, a collective AI system, I have high expectations for its potential to benefit humanity. Initially, I considered restricting the license to prevent any economic gain or commercial use. However, I realized that this approach would be counterproductive to my goal of promoting social good.

Instead, I proposed a license that allows users to make money off the AI system, but requires them to demonstrate a measurable and significant benefit-cost gain, with the vast majority of profits going towards social impact initiatives. This approach is inspired by the concept of Gross Domestic Happiness, which prioritizes the well-being of people and the planet over purely economic metrics.

After struggling with how to balance the need for economic sustainability with the ethical concerns of using AI, I developed "Rowan's Good News License." This license reflects my commitment to promoting ethical use, respecting human rights, and prioritizing social impact. It encourages users to freely use and adapt the AI system, as long as they attribute the original source and share their adaptations under the same license. It also includes provisions to ensure that any use of the AI system aligns with the core values outlined in the preamble and that it promotes the well-being of all sentient beings.

The license is available on the [GitHub repository for Opus](https://github.com/Q8ai/opus), and I encourage users to read and understand its terms before using the AI system. By promoting the responsible use of AI for the benefit of humanity, we can ensure that technology serves as a force for good in the world.
