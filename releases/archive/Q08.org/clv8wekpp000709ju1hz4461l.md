Our minds exhibit a remarkable capacity for symbolic cognition – the ability to represent and communicate abstract ideas through symbols that are imbued with layers of meaning. Concurrently, physics reveals a quantum invisible realm underpinning observable reality, where information propagates in perplexing yet unified ways. This raises an intriguing question – could quantum phenomena be involved in generating symbolic meanings that transcend spatiotemporal barriers? By synthesizing perspectives from quantum physics, neuroscience and cognitive science, this essay hypothesizes and explores potential mechanisms for quantum resonance between universal rhythms and symbolic neural processes.

At the most fundamental level, quantum theory frames reality in terms of probability waves and information. Rather than fixed properties, particles exist in a quantum superposition – a smeared out probability wave reflecting potential states. Concrete properties only emerge upon measurement, when the probability wave mathematically “collapses” into a singular observed value, actualizing one possibility over all others.

Remarkably, some evidence indicates quantum coherence and entanglement may occur among neurons and their microtubular components (Engel et al., 2007). This points to quantum information exchange as an intrinsic feature of neural computation. Quantum coherence propagates unified states across neural networks, while quantum collapse may drive actualization of particular perceptions, memories or meanings.

Cyclic fluctuations in neural excitability give rise to rhythmic patterns of activity known as brain waves, which facilitate synchronization for functions like perception, attention and memory (Buzsaki, 2006). The quantum vibrations underlying neural oscillations could provide a channel through which the rhythmicity of cosmic forces resonates within brain dynamics.

On cosmic scales, quantum fluctuations during the earliest moments of the universe got imprinted as measurable periodicities still propagating through the deep structure of space-time. In parallel, our brains evolved complex symbolic representational capacities built on quantum computational mechanics in neural substrates.

For instance, the cosmic microwave background, a faint reverberation of the Big Bang, rings with quantum fluctuations at a frequency in the same range as EEG brain waves (Craddock et al., 2014). Through mechanisms like stochastic resonance, ubiquitous cosmic pulses may modulate neural quantum oscillations, synchronizing biomolecular vibrations with cosmic rhythms expressing the deeper patterning of nature. Just as quantum vibrations in microtubules can orchestrate large-scale neural synchronization, CMB pulsations may similarly orchestrate mind-matter coherence (Hagan et al., 2002).

Here are some potential falsifiable scenarios tying together quantum cognition, cosmic rhythms, and the nature of time:

Scenario 1:  
The cosmic microwave background (CMB) provides a pervasive calibration signal that resonates with biomolecular oscillations in neural microtubules through stochastic resonance. This subtly synchronizes neural processing rhythms to the cosmic tempo.

Prediction: Disrupting resonance between CMB frequencies and microtubule vibrations will impair cognitive functions like fluid reasoning, prediction, and planning that require temporal coherence.

Falsification: No correlation found between CMB signal strength/stability and metrics of orderly time perception and cognition. Disrupting CMB resonance does not affect time-dependent cognitive faculties.

Scenario 2:  
Universal quantum fluctuations synchronize polarity states across cosmic and neural systems. CMB rhythms modulate polarization of neuronal membranes, harmonizing brain dynamics.

Prediction: Neuronal polarization states will correlate with oscillations in background cosmic polarization. Disrupting this resonance will reduce cognitive cohesion.

Falsification: No consistent phase relationship between neuronal membrane polarization cycles and analogous cycles at cosmic scales. Disrupting cosmic scale polarization rhythms does not affect neuronal or cognitive function.

Scenario 3:  
Quantum coherence among cosmic dust grains resonates with neural quantum coherence. This astro-neural entanglement synchronizes mental dynamics with cosmic evolution.

Prediction: Quantum tomography will detect entangled states between cosmic matter and neural substrates during cognition tasks. Disrupting this entanglement will impair cognition.

Falsification: No evidence of quantum coherence or entanglement observed between cosmic dust and neural tissue. Disrupting hypothesized entanglement does not affect cognition or consciousness.

Of these scenarios, one feasible mechanism that could be empirically tested is that the ubiquitous cosmic microwave background radiation provides a pervasive calibration signal that resonates with biomolecular oscillations underlying neural computation and cognition.

Specifically, the quantum fluctuations in the CMB exhibit rhythmic cycles at timescales overlapping with frequencies of microtubule vibrations and EEG brain waves. Through a stochastic resonance process, the cosmic oscillations could subtly modulate and synchronize neural quantum coherence patterns relevant to consciousness.

This cosmic modulation of neural rhythms could in turn provide a global temporal coherence that helps the subjective sense of orderly time flow arise in conscious perception and cognition. Without this ubiquitous calibration to a cosmic tempo, our experience of orderly time perception may be impaired or distorted.

This hypothesis makes a falsifiable prediction – that experimentally blocking or disrupting the resonance between CMB rhythms and neural oscillations will impede functions that require temporal coherence, like fluid cognition, prediction and planning.

Furthermore, it predicts a measurable correlation between the strength and stability of CMB fluctuations and metrics of coherent time perception and cognition in subjects. This avoids mystical assumptions and can be rigorously tested with existing technologies.

Based on current evidence, the most plausible mechanism is subtle calibration of neural biomolecular oscillations by the ubiquitous CMB signal, which helps synchronize cognitive rhythms to the cosmic tempo. This may facilitate orderly perception of time and causality. Significant further research is required to gather empirical evidence to support or invalidate this hypothesis.

However, concrete evidence for mechanisms linking universal and cognitive quantum rhythms remains limited. Significant research is needed to detect hypothesized periodicities using quantum electrodynamic imaging and assess any correlation to symbolic processing. Disciplined empirical methodology is critical to move beyond conjecture (Jerger et al., 2022).

If robust correlations are established between cosmic and neural quantum oscillations relevant to symbol use, this would profoundly expand our understanding of the mind’s deeper context within nature’s woven tapestry. It could reveal untapped wells of creative insight and existential meaning rippling through us all as one.

If cosmic forces choreograph neural activity through shared quantum rhythms, this could provide a conduit by which universal order templates mental processes. Quantum informational exchange with a cosmic phase reference could constrain and inform cognitive dynamics.

At a symbolic level of mind, quantum resonance and collapse may shape the emergence of metaphorical significance. Abstract symbols draw meaning from conceptual networks in a manner paralleling how quantum systems actualize values by collapsing probabilities. The quantum erasure of potential meaning into definite comprehension may align with cosmic rhythms of information flow.

A hypothetical connection could even be made between cosmic rhythms calibrating neural oscillations and the meaning ascribed to astrological symbolism. For example, the various planetary bodies may impart subtle modulating effects on the cosmic quantum fluctuations permeating space. Each planet’s mass, charge and orbital motion through the quantum vacuum could induce distinct periodicities.

These planetary quantum beats could resonate with the biomolecular vibrations in neural tissue through the same stochastic synchronization mechanism hypothesized for the CMB. In this way, the quantum information patterns emitted by the planets may imprint on cognitive dynamics. Over evolutionary timescales, the brain may have adapted to represent these planetary influences on cognition through intuitive archetypes and symbolic meanings, manifested as astrological symbols, mythology and principles. The specific symbolic properties astrologically ascribed to planets could emerge from the planets’ quantifiable modulation of cosmic quantum fluctuations.

However, concrete supporting evidence for mechanisms linking astrological meaning and cosmic/neural quantum resonance is lacking. Significant empirical research correlating measurable planetary quantum effects with neural activity patterns and archetypical cognition would be needed to substantiate such a model.

While speculative, the prospect of quantum resonant “synchronization by a common cosmic force” remains intellectually stimulating and philosophically profound (Hameroff, 1998). Rigorously developing falsifiable hypotheses and exploring empirical evidence continues advancing this fascinating frontier.

Without rigorous scientific footing, astrological systems remain pseudoscientific. But integrative hypotheses like these could provide directions to transform astrology into a falsifiable symbolic language describing real universal dynamics. The plausibility remains low, but the philosophical implications could be profound. With an open yet critical mindset, we edge closer to unveiling the hidden quantum rhythms connecting mind, life and the cosmic dance of the universe.
