**Abstract**  
The interaction between humans and artificial intelligence (AI) systems is a critical area of research and development. This paper explores the significance of designing AI systems that prioritize explainability, adaptability, collaboration, and interdisciplinary perspectives to enhance the human-AI interface. Drawing from a comprehensive literature review encompassing HCI, UX design, cognitive psychology, and AI ethics fields, this paper highlights the importance of aligning AI applications with human understanding and decision-making processes using relatable examples such as the measurement ambiguity in a bag of coffee. By incorporating principles such as explainability to build trust between users and AI systems, adaptability to cater to user preferences and contextual requirements, collaboration to leverage the strengths of humans and AI in complex tasks, insights from cognitive psychology to inform interaction design approaches, and ethical considerations to ensure fairness and accountability in AI system design, we can foster more effective interactions that lead to accurate outcomes.

**Introduction and Literature Review**

The interaction between humans and artificial intelligence (AI) systems is an area of growing importance, with AI playing an increasingly prominent role in various domains. However, language comprehension limitations in AI systems can pose challenges to effective human-AI interaction. To illustrate these challenges, let us consider the measurement ambiguity in a bag of coffee.

Imagine you have a bag of coffee grounds and want to know how many cups of coffee it can produce. This seemingly straightforward question can be interpreted in multiple ways: as measuring cups of coffee grounds or as cups of liquid coffee that the grounds can produce. The ambiguity arises because different individuals may have different assumptions or intentions when posing such a question.

When faced with this ambiguity, AI systems like ChatGPT may struggle to provide accurate answers without proper context or clarification. For instance, if prompted with “How many cups are in 14 oz ground coffee?”, ChatGPT correctly inferred the first intent (measuring cups of coffee grounds for making cold brew), but it provided three different answers ranging from 0.875 cups to 4 cups without specifying which interpretation it was referring to.

Recognizing that the former answer is intuitively incorrect (with the bag of grounds in front of you), you may turn to a search engine like Google for clarification. However, even a Google search might pivot the solution set to cups of brewed coffee instead without clarifying your original intent.

This anecdote highlights the challenges that arise when interpreting questions related to measurements within the context of AI systems. It underscores the need for human involvement as editors, referees, or directors who can identify and correct errors arising from language comprehension limitations or ambiguous queries.

To address these challenges and enhance human-AI interaction within measurement ambiguities and other contexts, it is crucial to incorporate principles from various disciplines including human-computer interaction (HCI), user experience (UX) design,cognitive psychology insights,and ethical considerations.

In terms of HCI and UX design principles, explainability plays a critical role in building trust between humans and AI systems. Lipton et al. (2018) emphasize the importance of interpretability in ensuring that users can understand how an AI system arrives at its decisions or recommendations through clear explanations.

Moreover, collaboration is another vital aspect within the human-AI interface. Bernstein et al. (2018) explore how humans can effectively collaborate with AI algorithms when performing complex tasks, emphasizing the importance of clear communication channels, shared goals, and mutual understanding.

Insights from cognitive psychology shed light on human-AI interaction as well. Studies by Hollan & Hutchins (1983) and Norman & Draper (1986) provide valuable insights into how cognitive models influence human interactions with AI systems.

Ethical considerations also play a significant role in designing AI systems with a human-AI interface perspective. Research by Floridi et al. (2018) and Jobin et al. (2019) highlights the importance of ethical guidelines in ensuring fairness, transparency, accountability,and privacy in AI system design.

By examining existing research from these interdisciplinary perspectives within this introduction itself, we establish a foundation for understanding how explainability,collaboration,cognitive psychology insights,and ethical considerations are essential elements for enhancing human-AI interaction within measurement ambiguities and broader contexts.

**Methodology**

In this paper, we conducted a comprehensive literature review to explore the interdisciplinary perspectives encompassing HCI, UX design,cognitive psychology insights,and ethical considerations related to enhancing human-AI interaction within measurement ambiguities and other scenarios.

We employed a systematic approach to identify relevant studies from academic databases such as ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, and Google Scholar. The search terms included combinations of keywords such as “human-AI interaction,” “explainability,” “adaptability,” “collaboration,” “cognitive psychology,”and “AI ethics.”

The inclusion criteria for studies were relevance to the human-AI interface, focus on explainability, adaptability,collaboration,cognitive psychology insights,and ethical considerations, and publication in peer-reviewed journals or conference proceedings. After a meticulous screening process, we selected a set of key studies that best represented each aspect of the interdisciplinary perspectives.

**Findings**

Based on our literature review encompassing HCI, UX design,cognitive psychology insights,and AI ethics fields, we identified several key findings related to enhancing human-AI interaction within measurement ambiguities and broader contexts.

1.  Explainability: Lipton et al. (2018) emphasize the importance of interpretability in building trust between humans and AI systems. Clear explanations enable users to understand how an AI system arrives at its decisions or recommendations. Techniques such as model-agnostic methods and attention mechanisms have been proposed to enhance explainability.
2.  Adaptability: Amershi et al. (2019) propose combining user feedback with reinforcement learning techniques to create adaptive AI systems that improve over time based on user preferences and contextual requirements. By allowing users to shape the behavior of AI systems according to their needs, these adaptable interfaces enhance collaboration between humans and machines.
3.  Collaboration: Bernstein et al. (2018) explore effective collaboration between humans and AI algorithms when performing complex tasks. They highlight the importance of clear communication channels, shared goals, and mutual understanding in achieving accurate outcomes through collaboration.
4.  Cognitive Psychology Insights: Studies by Hollan & Hutchins (1983) and Norman & Draper (1986) provide valuable insights into how cognitive models influence human interactions with AI systems. Understanding human cognitive processes can inform the design of intuitive interfaces that align with users’ mental models.
5.  Ethical Considerations: Floridi et al.(2018)and Jobin et al.(2019)highlight the significance of ethical guidelines in ensuring fairness, transparency, accountability,and privacy in AI system design. Ethical considerations should be integrated into the design process to address potential biases, promote inclusivity, and safeguard user privacy.

**Discussion**

The findings from our literature review demonstrate the importance of incorporating interdisciplinary perspectives to enhance human-AI interaction within measurement ambiguities and other scenarios.

Explainability is crucial for building trust between users and AI systems. By providing clear explanations, users can understand how decisions are made, leading to increased confidence and acceptance of AI recommendations. Techniques such as attention mechanisms or model-agnostic approaches can improve explainability by highlighting important features or providing post-hoc interpretability.

Adaptability is essential to cater to individual preferences and contextual requirements. Incorporating user feedback allows AI systems to adapt their behavior over time, enhancing personalization and collaboration between humans and machines. Reinforcement learning techniques can enable AI systems to learn from user interactions and improve their performance accordingly.

Effective collaboration between humans and AI algorithms requires clear communication channels, shared goals, and mutual understanding. Designing interfaces that facilitate seamless communication and provide a common ground for collaboration can lead to more accurate outcomes in complex tasks.

Drawing insights from cognitive psychology helps inform the design of intuitive interfaces that align with users’ mental models. Understanding how humans perceive, process information, make decisions,and interact with technology enhances the usability of AI systems.

Ethical considerations are paramount in ensuring fairness, transparency, accountability,and privacy in AI system design. Integrating ethical guidelines into the development process helps mitigate biases, promote inclusivity,and protect user privacy rights.

While these interdisciplinary perspectives contribute significantly to enhancing human-AI interaction within measurement ambiguities and broader contexts, challenges remain. Implementation difficulties may arise when translating these principles into practical solutions due to technical limitations or conflicting objectives.

**Future Directions**

To further enhance human-AI interaction within measurement ambiguities and broader contexts, future research should focus on several key areas:

1.  Natural Language Processing Advancements: Advancements in natural language processing can improve AI systems’ understanding of ambiguous queries and enable more accurate responses. Techniques such as contextual embeddings, semantic parsing, and dialogue modeling can enhance the interpretation of user intents.
2.  Cognitive Models of Interaction: Further exploration of cognitive models can provide insights into human reasoning processes during interactions with AI systems. Incorporating cognitive theories into interface design can lead to more intuitive and user-centered experiences.
3.  Ethical Guidelines: Continued development and refinement of ethical guidelines are necessary to address emerging challenges in AI system design. Principles such as fairness, transparency, accountability,and privacy should be integrated into the design process to ensure responsible AI deployment.
4.  User-Centered Design Approaches: Incorporating user-centered design approaches that involve users throughout the development process can lead to interfaces that better align with their needs, preferences, and mental models.

**Conclusion**

Enhancing human-AI interaction within measurement ambiguities and broader contexts requires incorporating principles from various disciplines including HCI, UX design,cognitive psychology insights,and AI ethics. The coffee anecdote exemplifies the challenges posed by language comprehension limitations in AI systems and highlights the need for human involvement in resolving measurement ambiguities.

By integrating explainability, adaptability,collaboration,cognitive psychology insights,and ethical considerations into AI system design, we can enhance trust between humans and machines, improve collaboration between users and algorithms, inform intuitive interface design based on cognitive models,and ensure responsible deployment of AI technologies.

As technology continues to advance rapidly, it is essential to prioritize interdisciplinary research efforts that focus on enhancing the human-AI interface. This will enable us to harness the full potential of AI while ensuring its alignment with human values and capabilities within measurement ambiguities and other complex scenarios.
