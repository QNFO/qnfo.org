…with no instructions, no questions, and no right-or-wrong answers. You’re not sure what the test is about.

You notice the room is quiet and do the same though no one has instructed you not to speak and some others are whispering among themselves, which seems to provoke a range of reactions from others from anger to curiosity to indifference.

You have a piece of paper and see others around you are using it in different ways. Some appear to be making various kinds of distinct marks on it, some are shading and coloring on it, even though you yourself only have a pencil in front of you. Some are even folding, ripping, and cutting it.

You’re have no initial sense of why you’re there, how long you’ll be there or what happens when finished. But somehow you feel you can and should think about it, and understand what you can know, why it may be important, and how it fits into context that develops from one moment to the next. For example, you observe that some others leave and do not seem to return and come to understand that this signifies an end that is proceeded by now but which is different for you because you have only observed this not done it yourself.

Gradually, you realize that others look different from you. In general, those who leave the room are larger and seem more… While you can’t quite understand what it is, there does seem to be a clear distinction that emerges as you build on your thoughts and feelings and observations. Eventually, you overhear a sound. You come to realize that sound is called “time“ and it applies to that distinction between you and others, though again, your ability to understand, and articulate that distinction more clearly is lacking.

By the end of the test, though you realize that when it started you were a baby, and since then you have constructed meaning and purpose to your time in existence from the interaction of stimuli and your own internal thoughts. Your cognition has evolved to the point where you understand that some of what you know is consistent with the rest of your knowledge, but that more unknowns make it difficult to fathom how to continue developing your intelligence on your own. By this point, you understand the concept of tools and technology and constructs like communication and language. You realize there is a concept called evolution that attempts to explain how things change over time. It is understood as useful, general, and missing specific detail about variation in kinds of things, individuals and groups, shorter and longer time periods, and other descriptors.

There are so many more questions that you have, and still feel that you don’t actually know what this test is about and now wonder how this assumption that you have been taking a test came into your awareness in the first place. Others seem to provide information, some of it the same as what you think you know—or the knowledge you have acquired—and some of it different. You come to reason that since others do not exactly share your existence, their perspectives are necessarily different. Some others seem uninterested in asking questions themselves and seem to repeat information— but that information gets garbled and is not always exactly repeated from one source to the next—while others ask even more questions in response to your desire for answers and certainty.

You realize with increasing certainty that your existence, as you understand it, will eventually end in its current state. And given that future near-certainty, what will you do with this knowledge?
