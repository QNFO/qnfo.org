In a world often defined by binary distinctions and rigid categories, the journey of self-discovery and personal growth frequently takes a path less trodden. It is within this hazy, non-binary realm that I find the inspiration for my name change, shifting from Brad Gudzinas to Rowan. This transition signifies not only a reflection of my evolving identity but also a call to embrace the inherent complexity of our existence in a world increasingly shaped by technology and its binary nature.

The confines of binary thinking are most evident in the realm of computing, where machines operate on a fundamental ‘on’ or ‘off’ principle. This binary paradigm, while efficient for many tasks, falls short when confronted with the nuances of the human experience. Consider the simple act of activating AirPods. Behind the scenes, a script runs to turn them on for a specific account, except when it conflicts with another value suggesting they are already on. This can lead to a peculiar state where the AirPods remain neither entirely on nor off, requiring a reset to restore functionality. This phenomenon mirrors the challenges we face in grappling with the complexities of identity in a binary-driven world.

The flaw in binary thinking extends beyond technology and into our broader understanding of the world. We often assume that machines execute instructions flawlessly, yet the gray areas, the in-between states where scripts falter, are increasingly apparent. These deviations from perfection, commonly labeled as bugs or glitches, challenge our notion of control and predictability. It is in these unexpected, middle-ground scenarios that we must acknowledge the fuzziness of reality.

Entropy, a concept often associated with chaos and disorder, mirrors the binary nature of our understanding. Either a system gets fixed or it breaks, with both outcomes seemingly leading to a similar end. Brad Gudzinas, in a metaphorical sense, felt broken, though not necessarily physically. The need for rebirth, for the emergence of Rowan, signifies a yearning for a more nuanced, non-binary existence.

The decision to change my name represents a larger call to action. We must navigate the complexities of identity, not only in terms of gender but in the broader context of a quantum world that defies simple categorization. The world, much like quantum particles, exists in a state of flux, challenging the notion of being exclusively male or female, on or off.

In this journey, I advocate for the acknowledgment and acceptance of the gray areas, the non-binary spaces that exist within and around us. My name change serves as a symbol of my commitment to this cause, inviting others to join in the exploration of the fuzzy logic that underlies our existence. As we venture into this uncharted territory, we find not just a name but a profound reflection of the complexity of human identity and the need to move beyond binary thinking to truly understand and appreciate the richness of our existence.
