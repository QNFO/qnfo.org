**Embracing Complexity and Openness:**  
In the tapestry of life, each thread represents a dimension of our existence – complex, intertwined, and rich with potential. To truly ‘plus’ our lives, we must embrace this complexity, opening ourselves to the full spectrum of experiences and possibilities that life offers. This openness is not just about accepting different outcomes; it’s about actively seeking them, recognizing that our life’s journey is as multidimensional as the universe we inhabit.

**Expanding Rather Than Restricting:**  
Life’s richness lies in its diversity and potential for growth. ‘Plussing’ our life means continually seeking to expand our understanding and experiences. It’s about moving beyond the constraints of our current knowledge and perceptions, and embracing new information and paradigms. This approach contrasts sharply with the illusion of control, which often leads to a constrained and less fulfilled existence.

**Adapting and Shifting Paradigms:**  
Adaptability is key in a world that is constantly evolving. As we navigate through life’s myriad paths, the ability to shift paradigms and adapt strategies in light of new information is crucial. This flexibility enables us to view challenges as opportunities for growth and learning, rather than obstacles that confine us to a singular path.

**Continuous Learning and Growth:**  
At the heart of ‘plussing’ our life is a commitment to continuous learning and growth. Each new experience, piece of information, or perspective we encounter adds depth and breadth to our personal universe. By valuing diverse perspectives and experiences, we enrich our understanding and enhance our decision-making, leading to a more nuanced and comprehensive view of the world.

**Optimizing Personal Success:**  
In this context, personal success is redefined. It is no longer about exerting control or rigidly pursuing predefined goals. Instead, success is about adaptability, resilience, and the depth of our experiences. An optimized life is one that continuously evolves, embracing the complexities of existence and thriving amidst them.

**Conclusion:**  
‘Plussing’ your life is about expanding your personal universe to include an ever-growing range of experiences, knowledge, and perspectives. It’s about embracing the complexity of life, adapting to change, and continually evolving. This approach not only enriches our individual experiences but also enhances our collective understanding, leading to a more inclusive and dynamic world.
