And I don’t mean that to sound fatalistic, but it’s definitely nihilistic, which is also not pessimistic, so I’m trying to come to terms with that. But I know the answer, but I have self doubt causes me to question that.

> Contemplating the meaning or meaninglessness of existence is a profound and timeless aspect of the human condition. Nihilism, the philosophical viewpoint that traditional values and beliefs are unfounded, and that existence is senseless or useless, does not necessarily lead to pessimism. It can also lead to a form of liberation or the adoption of new values and meanings.
> 
> The feelings you’re describing—nihilism mixed with self-doubt—suggest that you’re grappling with deep existential questions while also recognizing that your own perspective might have limitations or could be subject to change. It’s not uncommon for individuals to understand something intellectually but still have emotional or psychological responses that seem at odds with that understanding.
> 
> Here are a few strategies that might help you come to terms with these feelings:
> 
> 1.  **Philosophical Inquiry**: Engage with philosophical texts and ideas. Existentialist philosophers like Søren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Albert Camus have delved deeply into the concept of meaning in life. Their works might offer you different perspectives on how to find or create meaning.
> 2.  **Mindfulness and Meditation**: Practices like mindfulness and meditation can help you to sit with uncomfortable thoughts without judgment, allowing you to observe your thoughts and feelings with detachment and perhaps gain insight into them.
> 3.  **Creative Expression**: Sometimes, expressing these feelings through art, writing, or music can be therapeutic and revealing. It can help you to externalize your thoughts and explore them from a different angle.
> 4.  **Dialogue and Community**: Talking with others about these feelings can be immensely helpful. Whether it’s friends, family, or a community (online or in-person) that explores these topics, sharing your thoughts and hearing others’ perspectives can be enlightening.
> 5.  **Professional Guidance**: Sometimes, the guidance of a therapist or counselor is beneficial, especially if these thoughts are causing distress or interfering with your daily life.
> 6.  **Practical Engagement**: Sometimes, engaging in volunteer work or contributing to a cause can provide a sense of purpose and help to counter feelings of meaninglessness.
> 7.  **Literature and Stories**: Reading literature that explores these themes can offer comfort, insight, or even potential answers. It helps to know others have trodden this path and have left records of their journeys.
> 8.  **Physical Activity**: Regular exercise or engaging in sports can help take your mind off existential questions and can improve your mood. It also serves as a reminder of the physical aspect of existence and the joy that can be found in bodily experiences.
> 
> It’s important to remember that questioning the meaning of existence is a sign of deep introspection and a search for authenticity in your life. It’s okay to not have all the answers and to live with uncertainty. Over time, you might find that the journey of exploration is itself meaningful.
