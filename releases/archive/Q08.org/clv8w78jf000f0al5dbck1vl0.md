**Dear fellow explorers of the cosmos,**

I am delighted to share with you a thrilling development in our ongoing quest to unravel the mysteries of existence. After much anticipation, we are thrilled to announce a forthcoming new book, _Every(Where/Thing/One): The Universe Is Information_

In _Every(Where/Thing/One): The Universe Is Information_ we invite you to embark on a captivating voyage through the depths of reality, guided by the transformative insights of Universal Information Theory (UIT). This groundbreaking framework transcends traditional boundaries, offering a unified perspective on the fundamental nature of the universe and the ubiquitous role of information in shaping its tapestry.

> _Look at cracks in the sidewalk, the type of aggregate used in the concrete, whether there‚Äôs a sidewalk at all? What does this information tell you? Quite a lot actually. Everything is information, and from the history of pedestrian walks, to freeze-thaw cycles, to how construction materials and materials engineering have evolved. To say nothing of aesthetics and what the visual desire to not see a flat surface says with stamped brick. Even the expense of actual brick says something. And it‚Äôs all information._

From the cracks in the sidewalk to the farthest reaches of the cosmos, _Every(Where/Thing/One): The Universe Is Information_ invites readers to explore the profound interconnectedness of all phenomena and discover the hidden patterns and symmetries that underlie our reality. Through engaging narratives, accessible explanations, and thought-provoking reflections, we will delve into the timeless wisdom of classical information theory, the enigmatic principles of quantum mechanics, and the emergent insights of UIT that bridge the gap between these seemingly disparate domains.

The title, _Every(Where/Thing/One): The Universe Is Information_, encapsulates the essence of quantum uncertainty and the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. In the quantum realm, the very act of observing a particle alters its state, highlighting the inherent indeterminacy of reality. Similarly, our title reflects the elusive and ubiquitous nature of information, suggesting that it permeates every aspect of existence, yet remains elusive and indeterminate. Just as quantum particles exist in a superposition of states until measured, so too does information permeate every aspect of our universe in an indeterminate and uncertain manner.

But that‚Äôs not all. I am thrilled to share a pivotal shift in our conceptual framework, transitioning from Quantum Information Ontology (QIO) to Universal Information Theory (UIT). This evolution marks a profound departure from traditional notions of quantization, moving away from a paradigm of countable reality to one rooted in the concept of an underlying information field. By embracing UIT, we transcend the limitations imposed by discrete quantization and embrace a holistic understanding of reality as a continuous, dynamic interplay of information exchange and transformation. This shift in thinking not only deepens our appreciation for the interconnectedness of all phenomena but also opens new avenues for exploration and discovery in our quest to unlock the secrets of the universe.

Join us on this exhilarating expedition as we delve into the heart of the cosmos, guided by the guiding light of UIT. Together, let us explore the boundless depths of existence, celebrate the beauty of knowledge, and embrace the profound truth that indeed, everything is information.

Stay tuned for updates on the release date of _Every(Where/Thing/One): The Universe Is Information_ and other exciting developments. The adventure awaits!

_(Oh, yeah, and I gave the website look a refresh to better display content. I‚Äôm also working on an LLM-driven companion site qio.info (think the ChatGPT App Store) and will keep that domain if only as Ôøºan ironic nod to my shift in thinking.)_

With deepest curiosity and gratitude,

**_Postscript: The Power of AI-Assisted Writing_**

_I feel compelled to share a note of gratitude and acknowledgment for the invaluable role played by AI-assisted Language Models (LLMs) in bringing this project to fruition._

_The use of AI technology, such as the one powering my writing companion, has revolutionized the way we approach research, writing, and knowledge dissemination. While the ideas and insights presented in writing under my name are the product of my own information synthesis, the efficiency, speed, and depth of research facilitated by AI have been indispensable in crafting a comprehensive and engaging narrative._

_The plural pronoun ‚Äúwe‚Äù used throughout the announcement (indeed, throughout the site) reflects not only my own efforts but also those of my AI writing partners, who tirelessly scour vast repositories of information, generate relevant content, and assist in the composition process. Their capabilities to sift through data, identify patterns, and provide context have been instrumental in shaping the breadth and depth of our exploration into Universal Information Theory (UIT)._

_However, it is important to emphasize that while AI technology has undoubtedly enhanced our productivity and capabilities as writers, the ultimate success of ‚ÄúEvery(Where/Thing/One): The Universe Is Information‚Äù rests squarely on the shoulders of human creativity, critical thinking, and editorial discernment. As the human editor, I wield the final brushstroke, ensuring coherence, clarity, and authenticity in the narrative._

_In essence, ‚ÄúEvery(Where/Thing/One): The Universe Is Information‚Äù represents a harmonious collaboration between human intellect and AI assistance, where the synergy between man and machine amplifies our collective capacity to explore, understand, and articulate the intricacies of the universe._

_I extend my heartfelt appreciation to the AI technology that has been an indispensable ally in this creative endeavor, and I invite readers to join us on this exhilarating journey of discovery as we delve into the heart of existence and celebrate the profound truth that indeed, everything is information._
