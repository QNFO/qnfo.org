The concept of quantum entanglement can be difficult to grasp because it defies our normal notions of space and time. However, we can understand it more intuitively by comparing it to clicking links on a website.

When you click on a link, you are instantly transported to a new webpage, no matter where in the world that website is hosted. The transfer of information happens immediately, without being limited by spatial distance.

Similarly, when two particles become entangled, they establish a connection that allows them to coordinate their properties instantaneously. It’s as if the particles formed a hidden link together through which information can be exchanged in no time, regardless of how far apart they become.

Just as we don’t think twice about websites enabling us to access information globally, we should update our perspective to recognize that at small scales, the universe operates on correlations between information, unhindered by physical distance.

Space and matter are macroscopic constructs that don’t capture what’s happening behind the scenes. At a fundamental level, the universe works more like the internet – an interconnected web of information exchange. When we grasp that space is not fundamental, quantum entanglement becomes far less mysterious.

The key is accepting that at small scales, information is primary, allowing linkages to form across traditional spatial barriers. Entanglement is just one of many phenomena arising from information being the underlying fabric of reality, not clunky matter moving through space. This principle doesn’t just apply in physics, but in understanding life and consciousness as well.

So next time entanglement seems puzzling, think of websites. The universe is an immense information network, and we are nodes exchanging information along countless invisible links, unconstrained by the illusion of space.
