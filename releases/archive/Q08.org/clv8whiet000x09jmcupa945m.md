I am not in control of the physical reality of my life, but control an even higher function creating and interpreting the meaning of my existence. And the latter form a feedback spiral through time, whose order is indeterminate or exists in feedback subroutines. These complex processes are separate from—but related to—systems that we think of as my individual being or human civilization in general, and also apply across taxonomies and domains, such as natural and physical phenomena from the smallest to the largest.

> It seems you’re suggesting that actions and their consequences are interconnected in complex ways, transcending the simple binary of good and bad. You also appear to emphasize the importance of personal interpretation and meaning-making in one’s life, which can interact with these actions and reactions in a feedback loop.
> 
> It’s important to note that different philosophical perspectives might offer alternative views on the nature of good and bad, control, and the relationship between individual beings and broader systems. While your perspective acknowledges the complexity of these processes across various scales, others may prioritize moral or ethical frameworks for evaluating actions.
