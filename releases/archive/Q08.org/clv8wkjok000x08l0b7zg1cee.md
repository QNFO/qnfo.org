Undeniably, the human psyche is a realm of wonder that holds the ultimate power to define our interpretation of the world we live in. At the heart of this discerning faculty lies our thoughts. Thoughts, an apparently simple and discrete entity, foster the lens through which we decipher our reality. However, a contentious discourse among philosophers, psychologists and scientists provokes the question: Are our thoughts real, or is their perceived reality, in itself, an illusion?

\## Contemplating the Reality of Thoughts

The challenge in adjudicating the reality of thoughts is contingent upon our definition of ‘reality.’ In the strict physical sense, thoughts lack a tangible form or unequivocal geographical location within the neural labyrinth of our brains. Yet, they exert undeniable influence on our emotions, actions, and perceptions.

Such evidence might nudge one towards classifying thoughts as real, but it is necessary to remember that our thoughts are fundamentally subjective interpretations and not objective truths.

\## Thoughts and Distorted Perception of Reality

Our minds harbor a profusion of thoughts, each one coming with their unique perspective and interpretation. However, these interpretations do not always align with the objective reality. We often assign meanings, relate past experiences or project future anxieties onto these thoughts, invariably leading to a distorted perception of reality.

Moreover, we tend to perceive our inner narrative formed by these thoughts as the absolute truth. This misalignment between the subjective reality of our thoughts and the objective reality can introduce cognitive distortions, heavily affecting our reactions and decision-making processes.

\## Embracing Cognitive Mindfulness

To unravel the distorted reality spun by our thoughts and perceive the world as it truly is, the practice of cognitive mindfulness becomes indispensable. This practice emphasizes recognizing thoughts as mere cognitive processes, thereby avoiding over-identification with them.

Through mindfulness, we can consciously create a space between our self and our thoughts. We can observe them without judgment or immediate reaction, allowing for clearer perception and deeper understanding. This process helps us to differentiate thoughts from facts and reduces the distortive influence they have over our reality.

\## Conclusion

An exploration into the realm of human cognition further stylizes the intriguing portrait of human thought. While they might not possess a tangible form or attribute to claim their “reality,” thoughts wield the ineffable power to shape our perceptions, actions, and emotions. Recognizing and addressing the distorted reality saturated with subjective thoughts paves the way for heightened self-awareness and more accurate perception of the world around us.

Indeed, untangling the entwined threads of thought and reality offers not just a rich, intellectual feast but also a roadmap to improved emotional and psychological wellbeing. It serves as a gentle reminder that every thought holds power over us only as long as we allow it to, thus reinforcing the significance of cognitive mindfulness in our lives.

As Buddha wisely explained, “We are shaped by our thoughts; we become what we think.”
