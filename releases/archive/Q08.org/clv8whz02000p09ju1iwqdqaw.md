To logically reason why what we consider good and bad are, in fact, all good, it is essential to consider various perspectives on reasoning, ethics, and human behavior. Good reasoning is a fundamental aspect of this discussion, as it involves the correct distinction between good and bad reasoning, and the worthwhile aspects of good reasoning (McHugh & Way, 2016). Additionally, the role of intuition in detecting logicality in reasoning is crucial, as even “bad reasoners” can detect the conflict between logicality and their intuitions (Morsanyi & Handley, 2012). Furthermore, the concept of good and bad is deeply intertwined with human life and evolution, as the concepts of good and bad make sense only within the logical space of reasons (Lee, 2023). In understanding good and bad reasoning, it is important to consider the beliefs about thinking, especially in children, where good reasoning involves a search for information or evidence to draw conclusions, consideration of multiple viewpoints, and being alert to biases, while bad reasoning involves automatic and emotional responses and biased appraisals of information (Amsterlaw, 2006). Moreover, the association of valence with left-right space and the creation of implicit associations linking “good” with “right” and “bad” with “left” further adds to the complexity of understanding the concept of good and bad (Casasanto, 2011). The normative collapse of logical pluralism and the concern of how an agent’s attitudes are based on one another also contribute to the discourse on good and bad reasoning (Blake-Turner, 2021). Additionally, moral epistemology is concerned with social practice where the criteria of good or bad are applied, rather than a priori ethical reasoning (Yu, 2017). Furthermore, the relation between judgments of immanent and ultimate justice in the context of “good” and “bad” victims adds another layer to the understanding of good and bad (Harvey & Callan, 2014). In the realm of philosophy, the relationship between facts and values, and the existential value of life, as well as the distinction between rational prudence and rational benevolence, are essential in understanding the concept of good and bad (Saariluoma, 2020; Willaschek, 2022; Lange & Protasi, 2021). Moreover, the role of envy, both benign and malicious, in motivating human behavior and the association of abstract concepts of “good” and “bad” with fluent and disfluent sides of space further enriches the discussion (Crusius et al., 2019; Kominsky & Casasanto, 2013). From a computational perspective, fuzzy logic and the binary nature of everything, including “good” or “bad,” provide a different angle to the concept of good and bad (Indahingwati et al., 2018). Additionally, human reasoning being biased by intuitive beliefs and the use of intuition-talk as a good habit for philosophers further adds to the complexity of understanding good and bad reasoning (Neys et al., 2010; Andow, 2017). In the context of governance, the notion of good and bad governance being multidimensional, continuous, and empirical, as well as the ethical issues surrounding consent to open label extension studies, contribute to the broader understanding of good and bad in societal contexts (Rockman & Hahm, 2011; Wainwright, 2002). In conclusion, the concept of good and bad reasoning is multifaceted, encompassing philosophical, psychological, ethical, and computational dimensions. It involves the correct distinction between good and bad reasoning, the role of intuition, the association of valence with space, the normative collapse of logical pluralism, and the multidimensional nature of governance. Understanding the concept of good and bad reasoning requires a comprehensive analysis of these diverse perspectives. References: Amsterlaw, J. (2006). Children’s beliefs about everyday reasoning.
