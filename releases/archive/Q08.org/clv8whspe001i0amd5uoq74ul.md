The hypothetical scenario of using a quantum computer to sniff and analyze encrypted communications for cryptocurrency showcases the fragility of digital “secrets.” Utilizing quantum computing to sniff out encrypted communications on local wireless networks, it is possible to analyze and decrypt this data in near real-time. This reveals information which may expose sensitive information or allow for the extraction of cryptocurrency from the encrypted communications.

The process of sniffing and analyzing the encrypted data is technically feasible, as [quantum computers are becoming increasingly accessible and powerful algorithms for encryption and decryption are already in existence](https://quni.io/2024/01/03/quantum-computings-potential-to-break-encryption-methods-and-the-applicability-of-amazon-braket-quantum-computing-infrastructure/). However, the process requires significant resources and requires a specialized team of experts to employ it successfully.

Finally, it is important to note that any past communication that has been stored, such as on encrypted hard drives, can potentially be decrypted in the future with quantum computing. This scenario serves as an important warning about the fragility of digital “secrets.”
