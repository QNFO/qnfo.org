The Power of Self-Absorption in Shaping Our Realities
=====================================================

In our quest for self-preservation and self-fulfillment, it is natural to prioritize our own thoughts and concerns. After all, our bodies are designed to perceive external events that may directly impact our physical well-being and survival. However, in our modern world, we have become increasingly reliant on the third-party accounts of others to understand and interpret the reality around us. This reliance on external narratives is doing ourselves a disservice, as it limits our ability to fully experience and shape our own realities.

One such moment occurred when I stopped my scooter next to a car on Hyde Street and found myself face to face with a lifeless body inside the vehicle. As I parked my kick scooter and focused intently on maintaining control, I was completely oblivious to the presence of the deceased individual. It was only after a police officer shouted, “Are you alive?” that I snapped out of my self-centered mindset and realized the gravity of the situation. In that moment, I became acutely aware of the impact that external realities can have on our perception of the world.

This incident made me question the reliability of our own perceptions and the role that third-party accounts and news sources play in shaping our realities. If I had not been alerted by the cop’s exclamation, the entire event would have gone unnoticed in my reality. This possibility suggests that there are countless occurrences and experiences that we miss or dismiss due to being consumed with our own thoughts and concerns.

By being more self-absorbed, we can embrace the power of our own perceptions and experiences. When we prioritize our internal thoughts and observations, we become more attuned to the nuances of our own lives. We are better equipped to navigate the complexities of the world around us, as we are not clouded by the perspectives and biases of others.

It is true that external events will always have some impact on our lives. However, by embracing self-absorption, we can filter and interpret these events through our own unique lens. We can actively shape and define our own realities, rather than passively accepting the narratives of others. This empowers us to live more intentional and fulfilling lives, free from the constraints of external influences.

The concept of third-person observer news further complicates this issue. In today’s digital age, we have unprecedented access to news and information from various sources. While this accessibility can be positive, it also presents challenges. Immersing ourselves in the narratives and perspectives of others increases our cognitive load and leads to information overload. Our brains struggle to process the influx of external information, leaving less capacity for our own thoughts and reflections.

Over-reliance on external narratives turns us into passive recipients of other people’s realities, disconnecting us from our unique perspectives. The influx of thoughts and experiences from others stifles our ability to generate original ideas and insights. Our internal organic thoughts, which can shape our individual experiences and contribute to the collective consciousness, are overshadowed by this overwhelming external information.

Finding a “balance” between engaging with external realities and nurturing our internal organic thoughts is crucial. By consciously allocating our attention and actively filtering the information we consume, we regain control over our cognitive load and reclaim the power of our own unique perspectives.

In conclusion, the incident on Hyde Street should not lead us to prioritize external realities at the expense of our own self-absorption. Instead, it should serve as a catalyst for us to embrace the power of our own perceptions and experiences. By being more self-absorbed, we can cultivate a deeper understanding of ourselves, shape our own realities, and live more authentic and fulfilling lives.
