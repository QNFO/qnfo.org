I am a homosexual with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and a drug habit. All three of these are, or at one time were diagnoses in the [DSM](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders). And as such the medical community (and society at large) treats/treated them as things to be fixed/solved/minimized/cured when I am coming to see that in fact, they are special gifts that, combined with my other attributes and perspectives on life, empower me. When I [wrote this other post recently](https://quni.io/2023/12/23/celebrating-diff-ability-a-reflection-on-developmental-abilities/), it prompted a reflection on the words we use, and our meetings associated with them, and then a more abstract mathematical consideration of vectors. Some go in one direction and others go in other directions (in hyper-dimensional space) because they each magnify each other and make that intervening choice set richer, more diverse, and—like the universe itself—expansive rather than contractive or reductive.

And yet, the message persists, but does it? Given the above prompt verbatim to two different flavors of ChatGPT (via API and iOS app), I interpreted somewhat different meanings:

> If you feel empowered by your attributes, it can be helpful to continue exploring your strengths and finding ways to harness them positively. However, if any aspect of your life causes distress or harm (such as drug habits), it might be worth considering seeking professional help or support from loved ones.
> 
> Excerpted from API response

> It sounds like you’ve gained valuable insights into embracing your unique qualities and perspectives. Embracing diversity and recognizing the richness it adds to our lives can indeed lead to a more expansive and inclusive understanding of the world. How has this perspective influenced your personal journey?

There is much to be considered with additional complexity that is unraveling over time as I continue writing this very post. But I think as with [my recent search for a Grand Unified Theory of Everything](https://quni.io/2024/01/05/research-plan-a-grand-unified-theory-of-everything-in-the-universes/) it’s actually pretty simple: find your own meaning of your existence.
