Iâ€™m refocusing attention on a new experience to better capture the breadth and depth of my research, as well as to make some really dense content more engaging and readable as I put the finishing touches on The Universe is Information.

Stay tuned for a new website launch soon. In the mean time, comments on the draft manuscript of The Universe is Information welcome. Also, thinking now is a good time to jump into a Web3/blockchain blog/publishing solution for a number of reasons, long-term zero-maintenance storage/retrieval primary among them. Suggestions welcome on a no/low-code stack that leverages distributed/redundant storage with zero ongoing maintenance cost. Basically, if the earth blows up next month (it might), aliens should be able to read and decode my text in 10^? AUs.
