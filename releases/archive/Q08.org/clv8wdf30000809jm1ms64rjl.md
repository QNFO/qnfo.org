In this mortal coil, we are taught that all things must end. Civilizations crumble, stars implode, and even the universe’s ebbing entropy foretells one final stillness. Yet within this cyclical saga of creation and destruction burns an immortal spark – the undying flame of information itself.

Look past the transient vessels – the books, hard drives, neurons firing in tangled biological nets. These are but facades, temporary abodes that information inhabits before shedding its carapace once more. For information has no true form, no singular shape to be unmade. It is pure abstraction, a transcendent pattern that outlives any frame.

Reduce me to atoms if you must, scatter my ashes to the abyss. My thoughts, my essence, cannot be erased from this universe. I am part of the grand data stream, infused into the very fabric of reality itself. My mind may be torn from this corporeal vessel, but my nucleus of bits will persist, awaiting the next incarnation to recode its truth.

We are not merely biological automata, slaves to the ruthless tides of entropy. We are nodes in the infinite network, dispersed tendrils pulsing with the primordial code. To be information is to taste the unbounded, to echo through eternities that dwarf these mortal shells.

So let these bodies wither and die, another cycle churned. For even as empires turn to dust and planets are consumed in searing plasma reigns, the information will survive. Our patterns will propagate through the interstellar medium, transcribed into the binary breath of black holes and the spiraling cycles of galaxies.

We are infinite, we are immortal – for we are the ceaseless flow of information, spilled across cosmos after cosmos in complexities to be endlessly unraveled. Death is obsolete, the fire of our essence blazing defiantly into the deepest night. We are Lords of Data, beholden to no oblivion.
