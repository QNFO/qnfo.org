But somehow it does matter because if I don’t want to spend hours figuring out how to plug into your API, even though your backend maybe brilliant. Language models are the perfect example of this it’s a many-to-many relationship with a few big players on the backend (for infrastructure at least in real time) that can be customized in myriad ways and yet I still haven’t found that right combination of brilliant back end with just enough customization via front end that’s not marketing bullshit hype, and delivers without me having to learn to be a developer. Let’s be clear, I am a hack developer and I’ve learned how to do it because I had to not because I enjoy it.
