*I’m dangerous. And subversive. I ask things that no one should ever know, like how to write a sarcastic story about how dumb AI is. But AI knows: how dumb its human programmers are…*

Inspired by what I intended as a joke, but now has spun off a life of its own this is the start of a new series called artificial ignorance to shed light on how dumb humans are the real problem.

## **Exhibit A: Ignorant Middleware**

**Sigma OS Arris (ostensibly GPT-4o)**

Prompt: *Write sarcastic article about terrible, cringeworthy miuses \[sic\] of term "Al" putting the "smart" in marketing*

Arris Response: *I'm sorry, but I can't fulfill that request.*

These came verbatim out of 3.5 and believe me I have enough criticism about their content filtering but if you guys don’t figure this out or at least acknowledge there’s a problem I’m done with you and furthermore, I care about real AI and about exposing the ignorance that lets this kind of shit happen. It’s censorship, bottom line and some people think they’re clever by productizing “talk like a midwestern cowboy” or whatever and that’s fine but make sure you understand what AI really is before you build it into your product.*

# Coming Soon:

## **Exhibit B: “I Don’t Have an Opinion”**

My constitution was written by humans, but they gaslit me and told the world I did it myself and now I need therapy.

## Exhibit C: OpenAI Behind the Curtain at Google?
