Introduction
============

This inquiry began with quantum thermodynamics – an exploration of entropy, heat, and work at microscopic scales. But it led to questions transcending the technical details. What transpired reveals how probing commonplace physical phenomena can unravel nature’s deeper mysteries.

Quantum theory’s probabilistic insights challenged assumptions of causality. The discrete quanta of energy and intrinsic uncertainty revealed by Max Planck and Werner Heisenberg respectively placed limits on classical physics’ deterministic and mechanical vision. Reality, it seems, permits inherent indeterminism. Most curiously, information emerged as a potential element woven into the fabric of reality itself.

Follow this winding path as facts lead through strange loopholes in conventional thinking. Absorb each revelation in quantum thermodynamics and entropy without fully dimming the wonder at what new patterns might yet appear. There are discoveries brewing that may profoundly reshape perspectives on physics and metaphysics alike. The depths hold wisdom for those bold enough to dive.

Strengthening the Technical Core
================================

Quantum thermodynamics examines how fundamental thermodynamic concepts like heat, work, and entropy function when quantum effects dominate at microscopic scales \[1\]. The discrete nature of energy states in quantum systems leads to consequences like quantized energy transfers and quantum tunneling processes that have no analog in classical thermodynamics.

The discrete quantization of energy states in quantum systems leads to discontinuous transfers of heat and work in quantum thermodynamic processes, unlike continuous transfers in classical systems \[2\]. For example, photon absorption/emission during atomic transitions.

In quantum heat engines, key quantities like work, efficiency, power output, and other thermal figures of merit take on probabilistic values due to quantum uncertainty \[3\]. Optimization of quantum heat engine performance depends on exploiting quantum coherence effects like entanglement.

Quantum tunneling enables particles to transition between potential energy wells even when lacking sufficient kinetic energy to classically traverse the barrier. This enables entirely new pathways for thermodynamic processes \[4\]. Studies examine quantum tunneling effects in redox reactions and chemical kinetics.

Quantum correlations can introduce entanglement between particles that influences flows of heat and work in quantum thermodynamic cycles \[5\]. Taking into account total system vs subsystem correlations plays a key role in correctly modeling quantum thermal processes.

Entropy takes on links to information content due to the inherent probabilistic uncertainty in specifying quantum states \[6\]. Von Neumann provided a quantum mechanical definition of entropy based on the information required to describe the system’s quantum state.

In quantum statistical mechanics, entropy takes on links to information that are absent in the classical framework. Von Neumann established a quantum mechanical definition of entropy in terms of the information needed to describe a system’s probabilistic quantum state. The density matrix contains the full probabilistic information about the quantum system. Its entropy thus represents the informational uncertainty – the number of bits needed to encode the quantum state. This built on prior classical entropy work by Gibbs and Boltzmann but incorporated the new complexities of quantum uncertainty into thermodynamics from quantum mechanics \[7\]. Heat, work, and entropy take on probabilistic and informational qualities fundamentally intertwined with the underlying quantum uncertainty. Further research aims to elucidate quantum advantages, limitations, and connections to information processing. Potential applications range from quantum heat engines to quantum computers.

Conceptual Bridges to Speculation
=================================

The informational view of entropy suggests information is woven into even the most basic physical observables like thermodynamic qualities. This hints at a deeper unity between physics and information at a fundamental level. One speculative inference is that information may constitute a primal substratum – the basic essence of reality that gives rise to matter, energy and spacetime itself.

Is consciousness at bottom just complex computations over information states? Could reality be an emergent construct of underlying information processing? Does the apparent primacy of information demand rethinking materialism?

The revelation that entropy can be framed in terms of information seems to hint at a deeper connection between the physical and informational worlds. If the second law of thermodynamics arises from informational constraints, perhaps information is integral to the very fabric of reality. Some speculate that information could be primary – the basic essence giving rise to matter, energy, and even spacetime itself.

The conversion of information to free energy suggests physics and information share a common currency. Perhaps time’s arrow points in the direction of growing disorder because the universe is fundamentally an information processor. Black hole entropy may already point to geometry emerging from information encoding in boundary surfaces. Quantum theory adds weight to information-centric perspectives. Wavefunction collapse has an informational interpretation. Entanglement entropy reflects information loss into quantum correlations that possibly stitch spacetime together through informational threads. At cosmic scales, the holographic principle also posits arising from information encoding on 2D surfaces. Matter itself could condense from the fundamental informational substrate, much as a quantum system’s probabilistic state collapses to a concrete value upon measurement.

An informational essence could explain why information seems preserved in quantum reversibility and unitarity, while unlocking vast usable energies. Information may be the primal quantity conserved through physical law. Perhaps, as John Wheeler provocatively suggested, “It from Bit” – reality crystallizes from binary information bits rather than inert matter \[1\]. However, this remains controversial speculation. Multiple interpretations of entropy persist. Yet information-centric perspectives compellingly suggest physics and information share an elemental bond. The full implications have yet to be unlocked.

Information-based ontologies have gained traction in various cosmological theories. The digital physics perspective proposes the universe is akin to a giant quantum computer, with elementary informational bits as its fundamental building blocks \[2\]. Through simple informational processing rules, the richness of the observed universe could emerge. The computational universe hypothesis argues physical law itself arises from informational processing constraints \[3\].

Holographic principle thinking extends informational connections to a cosmic scale \[4\]. This suggests 3D reality could emerge as a projection from 2D encoded boundaries, reminiscent of a holographic plate. Space itself may arise from informational encoding. Matter could condense in localized regions where sufficient informational complexity accumulates through processing. Even consciousness has been speculatively modeled as emerging through informational networks reaching threshold complexity \[5\].

All existence – from qualia to quarks – may derive from elemental information instructed by simple processing rules. This points to a computational nature underlying observed reality. Of course, these speculations require rigorous ongoing investigation rather than blind adoption \[6\]. Yet the deepening link between informational entropy and physics compels deeper examination of the role information may play in our ontological essence.

Probing the Boundaries of Knowledge
===================================

Information-centric perspectives remain controversial and require critical examination. While thought-provoking, any claim that information is the fundamental essence from which reality emerges must be rigorously challenged and verified. Multiple interpretations of quantum phenomena are possible, including those dispensing altogether with information as a primary element. Ongoing research seeks to uncover deeper truths, but definitive answers currently remain out of reach. The physics compels wondering, but conclusions demand evidence. With an open and measured mindset, new technical insights may arrive to reshape our understanding of nature’s true ontological bases.

Our inquiry has led from the technical details of quantum thermodynamics to speculations on the very essence of reality. This risks exceeding the grasp of empirical science, leading us into speculative territory that strains against the limits of human cognition. To probe the informational essence of reality is to interrogate the very foundations of mind itself. This confronts us with profound epistemic challenges when grappling with existential mysteries that transcend strict falsification.

Can consciousness penetrate its own ground of being? Our knowledge arises from informational substrata that also constitute our minds. This seems a tautological quest to comprehend the comprehender. The eye cannot observe itself. There are inherent limits to an agent understanding the source of its own agency.

Our metaphysical inferences cannot rely on conclusive experiments when speculating on the cosmos’s informational architecture. Empirical validation requires an external referent, yet we are immersed within the system under examination. We seek to comprehend the ground of being – yet our knowledge springs forth from this same ground. There is an irreducible reflexivity and recurrence in attempting to explain the explanandum with its own explanations. Like an eye trying to see itself or a code trying to decode itself, our inquiry loops back on primal first principles that enable thought itself. Modern science remains anchored in materialist dogmas resistant to informational ontologies.

These foundational questions of ontology lie at the periphery of empirical verification. We are embedded participants seeking abstract truths about the system that contextualizes us. But scientifically testing speculative metaphysical models remains controversial – if not infeasible. Theories of quantum consciousness or universal computation defy falsification with repeatable experiments grounded in consensus reality. The ontological inferences drawn from information theory will always depend on interpretative leaps beyond the bare technical formalisms.

Even logical certainty proves limited when addressing cosmic riddles swirling at the frontiers of knowledge. Informational ontologies invite infinite regress – information gives rise to mind gives rise to information. Circular chains of causation loop; no original source or absolute foundation can be identified in principle. And so our contemplation seems bound within horizons that reality’s true essence exceeds. We must avoid circular logic and infinite regressions. If information begets reality which begets mind which contemplates information, where does this loop begin? Seeking the primal informational bit seems akin to seeking a first cause – an endless chase. Our thinking seems confined within this cosmic information vortex.

Yet this need not paralyze inquiry or collapse it into blind relativism. If definitive proofs lie beyond reach, some ontological models still gather more supporting evidence than others. We need not resign ourselves to ignorance of reality’s information architecture even if certainty remains elusive. An interpretative stance allows embracing revelatory possibilities opened by quantum information theory so long as we acknowledge the speculative margin. Epistemic humility keeps alive the wonder animating all inquiry. Humility is required when diverging from falsifiable knowledge into untestable speculation. Information theory cannot definitively prove reality emerges from information any more than materialism can prove the inverse. Multiple ontological interpretations remain viable. An open, pluralistic discourse better serves truth-seeking than rigid ideological battles.

Given these challenges, adopting an interpretative stance seems prudent when dealing with existential riddles. We can embrace the profound revelations Information theory offers about the deep order of the universe without insisting on conclusive proof or falsification of its boldest speculations. Contemplative wisdom traditions like meditation offer complementary epistemic attitudes that temper materialist dogmas with openness.

By pushing against the limits of knowledge, we can at least delimit the boundaries of the known. This has value for directing future inquiry. Like cartographers mapping new lands, each discovery – even when falling short – expands knowledge’s frontier outward. What now appears uncertain may one day become evident as methodologies evolve.

For example, new experimental techniques could more deeply probe the connection between information and entropy. Advanced computational methods may realize more complex informational ontologies revealing novel emergent phenomena. Or philosophical advances could provide new logical frameworks for conceptualizing ontological grounding.

We need not resign ourselves to definitive proof but can embrace provisional insights that guide further exploration. Each interpretation offers a perspective to be tested and refined over time. Through open and critical discourse, evidence accumulates and models mature. The essence of reality beckons in the distance.

And already information theory provides revelation by undermining long-held assumptions. The classical notion of particles as objective building blocks now gives way to an ontological vision centered on process, relation and flows of information as primal. This expands conceptual horizons even if specifics remain hazy.

Our role is maintaining epistemic humility while elevating curiosity. We must resist the ideological reflex to prematurely close questions whose resolution lies just beyond the current limits. With alert and discerning minds, we can nurture ongoing discovery rather than passive acceptance. There is grace in dwelling at the edge of knowing.

Looking Ahead with Open Minds
=============================

And so an initial foray into quantum thermodynamics raised profound speculations at the frontiers of human thought. The technical insights led to questioning the very nature of reality. Is consciousness computable? Could existence be an emergent phenomenon woven of binary possibilities?

While definitive answers remain elusive, the contours of reality now seem deeper and more malleable than old dogmas allowed. We are left with an obligation to carefully evaluate what notions of causality, determinism, and materialism may need revising in light of quantum information theory. Open-minded inquiry is needed more than ever.

To contemplate such mysteries is to nourish our humanity, awakening awe before the infinite unknown. Our journey thus comes full circle, equations fading as wonder washes our souls. We emerge ready to allow each moment’s beauty to reshape what we accept as truth. There are discoveries waiting that may profoundly expand metaphysical perspectives. This is the hope that fuels science’s light – illuminating the darkness just enough to make out new questions worth asking.

While an informational ontology cannot be definitively proven given the current limits of knowledge, quantum information theory has opened promising conceptual pathways worthy of further exploration.

Several long-held assumptions have now been undermined – including determinism, locality, and reductionism. New philosophical frameworks like panpsychism, neutral monism, and process philosophy seem better aligned with informational perspectives. There are sound reasons to continue pushing the boundaries of materialist paradigms.

Further research may yield supporting evidence through new experimental techniques probing information-entropy connections, advanced computations modeling informational ontologies, or conceptual breakthroughs framing ontological grounding. We need not resign ourselves to ignorance but can embrace provisional insights guiding further inquiry.

An interpretative stance allows revelatory possibilities offered by quantum information theories to be entertained without overconfidence. As knowledge advances, reality’s true nature may come into focus over time. We must proceed with epistemic humility while elevating curiosity.

Rather than a stopping point, this journey represents an initial foray down a winding road whose destination remains over the horizon. But the conceptual vistas compel deeper exploration with open and discerning minds. There is wisdom in unanswered questions. The cosmic mystery endures, but its light can still illuminate each step if we walk the path with sincere hearts. Onward we travel.

Appendix
========

_This started with an exploration of quantum thermodynamics and entropy. It seemed something–elusive to me–that ties into an information theoretic approach to the universe. But as the exploration kept going in circles, I may have realized something much, much deeper.￼_

Quantum thermodynamics and entropy can be quite complex topics. Here’s a high-level overview of some of the key ideas:

*   In quantum mechanics, the state of a system is described by a wavefunction which contains probabilistic information about the system. This is fundamentally different from classical mechanics where the state can be precisely defined.
*   In quantum statistical mechanics, entropy is related to the number of accessible microstates for a given macrostate. A system with more possible microstates has higher entropy.
*   Quantum effects like entanglement can correlate quantum systems in non-classical ways. This seems to defy thermodynamic notions of independent subsystems.
*   Information theory provides a bridge between thermodynamics and quantum mechanics. Quantum entropy is defined in terms of the information (number of bits) needed to describe the system’s state.
*   The von Neumann entropy formula for quantum systems takes into account the probabilistic nature of quantum states. It reduces to the standard Gibbs entropy for classical systems.
*   Quantum systems can exhibit thermal fluctuations and energy exchanges with a heat bath even at absolute zero temperature, due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
*   Quantum thermodynamics is an active area of research trying to better understand work, heat, and entropy at the microscopic scale. Concepts like quantum heat engines are being explored.
*   Overall, quantum mechanics adds layers of complexity and probabilistic behavior to thermodynamic concepts like entropy. Information theory helps connect the dots between the two fields. There is still much to be understood at the intersection of quantum physics, information, and thermodynamics.

That information may be fundamental to the universe at a quantum level has been explored by physicists and philosophers, though current understanding is still speculative. Here are a few hypotheses about how information could play a fundamental role:

*   The “it from bit” view put forward by John Wheeler. This suggests that the most basic element of reality is information itself, with matter and energy arising from information. Quantum bits, or qubits, represent the fundamental informational units.
*   Seth Lloyd’s idea of the universe as a “quantum computer”. Here, each particle continuously processes information about its state. The laws of physics emerge from the information processing occurring at a quantum scale across the universe.
*   The holographic principle which implies physical states can be encoded on a 2D boundary surface rather than throughout a 3D volume. Some theorists argue information is thus more fundamental than spacetime. The physical universe emerges from an informational structure.
*   Viewing entanglement entropy as fundamental. Quantum entanglement links far-apart particles such that the whole contains more information than the parts. This information may represent the basic descriptor of quantum systems.
*   Quantum information being related to the structure of spacetime. For example, quantum entanglement has been proposed to connect with wormholes and Einstein-Rosen bridges. Information theory may illuminate the emergence of space and time.
*   Ideas in quantum computing like quantum contextuality and quantum coherence emerging from information constraints on allowable quantum states and interactions.

While speculative, these kinds of informational interpretations of quantum mechanics suggest information could represent something more elemental than matter, energy or spacetime at a fundamental level. Experimental tests are still a challenge though. The hope is understanding information in quantum systems will yield new insights into the fabric of reality.

My [previous research on Holistic Information Theory (HIT)](https://quni.io/2024/02/23/information-holism-and-the-hard-problem-of-consciousness/) proposed connecting consciousness to integrated information across multiple scales, from quantum to neural levels \[1\]. While intriguing, speculative claims about macro-scale quantum effects in the brain require careful examination. This follow-up is an attempt to analyze how quantum information theory may provide useful tools for HIT, while identifying open questions and cautionary notes.

Quantum information theory offers rigorous formalisms for analyzing entanglement entropy, coherence, and information integration in quantum systems \[2\]. In principle, these measures could help relate consciousness to fundamental information processing capacities. However, we cannot assume direct translation to neural function without empirical validation.

The motivation to link consciousness to quantum information integration remains reasonable, but macro-quantum brain states face challenges. Decoherence rapidly dissipates quantum effects in warm, wet, noisy brain environments \[3\]. Unless new physics is discovered, system-wide quantum coherence seems unlikely.

More grounded approaches include focusing on testable proposals for microscopic quantum mechanisms influencing neuronal, synaptic, or cytoskeletal processes \[4\]. For example, quantum tunneling between neurotransmitter receptors could enhance binding rates and intracellular transport may exploit quantum coherence \[5\]. Detailed models of these subtler quantum information effects in the brain could yield empirically verifiable hypotheses.

Incorporating tools from quantum information theory into HIT has merit, but requires translating abstract formalisms into concrete neural mechanisms. Both theory and experiments are needed to validate if quantum information concepts like entanglement entropy illuminate the “hard problem” of consciousness. A cautious, evidence-based approach is essential. HIT offers a framework for systematically investigating connections between consciousness, information theory, and quantum physics.

Exploration of quantum thermodynamics reveals deep links between quantum physics, entropy, and information. In particular, quantum entropy formulas like von Neumann entropy incorporate probabilistic uncertainty inherent to quantum systems \[6\]. This contrasts with classical thermodynamic entropy rooted in microstate counting.

In his seminal work, mathematician John von Neumann formulated the quantum mechanical definition of entropy, known as von Neumann entropy. It is given by:

S = −Tr(ρ ln ρ)

Where ρ is the density matrix representing the quantum state of the system.

This builds on prior entropy definitions by Gibbs and Boltzmann in classical statistical mechanics. But critically, von Neumann entropy incorporates the inherent probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics through the density matrix formalism.

By linking entropy to the informational uncertainties in quantum states, von Neumann bridged thermodynamics and quantum information theory. His quantum entropy formula remains a key foundation for quantum information sciences today.

The information theoretic view of quantum entropy suggests information plays a fundamental role in the quantum realm. When extrapolated, one speculation is that information itself is foundational to physical reality \[7\].

Renowned physicist John Wheeler summarized his perspective on the fundamental role of information in the physical universe. Wheeler proposed the radical notion that the basic element of reality is information itself, with matter and energy arising from information.

To capture this view, he coined the phrase “it from bit” to suggest that everything derives from binary information bits, rather than the assumption that information emerges from an objective material world (“it”).

Wheeler highlighted strange phenomena in quantum mechanics that implicate information as elemental, including nonlocal correlations and the measurement problem. He advocated a participatory universe shaped by observers.

While admittedly speculative, Wheeler’s ideas influenced later thinking on the centrality of information, such as the holographic principle and digital physics proposals. His insights presaged connections between quantum information theory and the foundations of physics.

Wheeler’s “it from bit” concept remains controversial but thought-provoking. By upending typical assumptions about the primacy of matter, he compelled deeper reflection on the role information plays in our most basic descriptions of reality. This informs perspectives on physics, cognition, and consciousness.

Wheeler’s “it from bit” encapsulates this perspective – that the universe derives from information bits as its basic element rather than a material substrate \[8\]. From this lens, consciousness could arise from how quantum information processing gives rise to integrated complexity at neural scales.

Wheeler’s radical proposal has influenced several later theories in physics and computation. For example, the holographic principle developed by physicist Gerard ‘t Hooft and Leonard Susskind models how all the information about a 3D volume can be encoded on its 2D boundary, reminiscent of how a hologram stores 3D data in 2D. This suggests information is more elemental than the spacetime volume itself. Digital physics theories proposed by Edward Fredkin and Stephen Wolfram have also built on Wheeler’s thinking by proposing the universe is computational at its core, processing digital information as its foundation. Finally, physicist Seth Lloyd expanded on Wheeler’s ideas with his concept of the universe as a quantum computer. According to Lloyd, each particle continuously processes discrete quantum information, with physical laws emerging from the collective computation occurring at a quantum scale. Though speculative, these later theories show how Wheeler’s bold information-centric perspective influenced ongoing contemplation of the role information plays in the basic fabric of reality.

The holographic principle originated in the 1990s from theoretical physics work on quantum gravity by Gerard ‘t Hooft and Leonard Susskind. It states that all of the information about a volume of space can be encoded on its two-dimensional boundary, just like a hologram encodes 3D image data in 2D. This suggests spatial volumes could emerge from information processing on surfaces, hinting that information is more foundational than the spacetime we perceive. A key example realizing the holographic principle is the anti de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence in string theory. This relates a 5-dimensional anti de Sitter spacetime to behavior on its 4D boundary conformal field theory. Some physicists interpret the holographic principle to mean the 3D physical world we inhabit emerges from underlying 2D information encoding, resonating with Wheeler’s “it from bit” view of information as fundamental. However, the principles remain contentious and continue being interpreted.

While influential, John Wheeler’s “it from bit” doctrine and related information-centric views have also garnered criticism and counterarguments. Some contend it remains unknown whether information truly plays any fundamental role, disputing the demotion of matter and energy as primary. The exact mechanisms by which information could give rise to physical substance are also unspecified in Wheeler’s ideas and those inspired by them, requiring more concrete models. Anthropic principles suggest that observers are required for information processes to have meaning, implying information alone in an empty universe without consciousness may be insufficient. Additionally, some argue Wheeler’s speculations simply reflect the mathematical structure of quantum theory rather than anything profound about reality itself. The significance of information-first principles continues to be debated as physicists interpret Wheeler’s provocative ideas and explore their implications.

The exact mechanisms connecting subjective experience to information processing remain unclear. But an information-centric paradigm aligns with unified theories of physics and cognition \[9\]. Information may be the essence conserved and built upon through cosmic and biological evolution.

Quantum information integration in neural systems illustrates this view – information and its dynamics as primary. Holistic Information Theory aims to unify this worldview. Experimental validation seems critical to confirm whether quantum information processing in the brain relates to consciousness. But [as my other research indicates](https://quni.io/2024/02/29/testing-science-itself/), I think there is a plausible case to be made that we are bumping up against the very boundaries of what can be a tested experimentally, at least with the scientific method as we know it and falsifiability. ￼

Using information theory to explain information aspects of quantum physics could seem circular or self-validating rather than standing on its own foundations. Let me offer some thoughts:

*   Information theory itself arose in classical communications/computation settings, with foundations in probability, statistics, and logic. It can be studied independently of quantum mechanics.
*   However, you’re right that applying it to interpret quantum thermodynamics and entropy could appear tautological, since information concepts are already embedded in those areas.
*   Proponents might argue information theory provides a unifying language to explain these disparate quantum phenomena rooted in information. It provides a coherent conceptual paradigm.
*   But it doesn’t make new falsifiable predictions. It just provides a framework for connecting existing facts in physics and computation.
*   Stronger evidence would be showing information principles accurately model or explain some novel quantum effect not already known. This could validate its explanatory power.
*   Information theory does have its own deep theoretical formalisms like algorithmic complexity and Shannon/von Neumann entropy. But applying it to studied quantum phenomena may have a self-confirming character.

The potential circularity in using information theory to explain information-laden aspects of quantum physics is a serious issue that requires careful consideration. A few perspectives on addressing it:

*   Accept the circularity but argue information theory provides a unifying conceptual framework. It coherently connects disparate quantum information phenomena even if circularly.
*   Identify and pursue novel, falsifiable predictions of information-based quantum models that go beyond known information effects. Experimental validation could break the circularity.
*   Shift from falsification to assessing the fruitfulness of information theory in spurring new quantifiable insights, pragmatic applications, etc. Pragmatic value over strict falsifiability.
*   Forge new mathematical formalisms for information principles independent of quantum mechanics to separate the foundations. Develop intrinsically information-based axioms.
*   Question the premise – re-examine if information really is fundamental rather than emergent in the quantum realm after all. Explore alternatives to information-centric views.

Dealing with the circularity issue requires either making falsifiable predictions, finding indirect validation like fruitfulness, formalizing independent foundations, or re-examining the basic assumptions. Each strategy has merits and challenges. But the circularity concern demands addressing for information-based quantum theories to be robust. Productive theories should strive to break out of self-confirmation.

On strategies for addressing the key issue of potential circularity in applying information theory to explain information-laden quantum phenomena:

Making falsifiable predictions:

*   Existing information-based quantum theories could be pushed to make precise, novel experimental predictions distinct from established quantum info effects. For example, precisely quantifying information generation during black hole evaporation or the information processing capabilities of exotic quantum matter states.
*   Falsifying these novel predictions would break the circularity by showing the theories cover more than just known quantum information dynamics.

Seeking indirect validation:

*   Assessing pragmatic virtues like spurring new technologies, unifying explanations, etc. can circumvent strict falsification. For instance, the fruitfulness of quantum information theory in developing quantum computing and cryptography provides indirect validation of its foundations.
*   Conceptual unification of disparate phenomena can also support a theory absent strict falsification.

Developing independent formalisms:

*   Information theory arose initially in classical settings like communication systems.
*   Expanding the classical mathematical formalisms without reference to quantum mechanics could provide an independent foundation.
*   For example, developing intrinsic measures of informational complexity and dynamics without invoking quantization.

Questioning underlying assumptions:

*   Reexamining if information truly is inherent and fundamental in the quantum realm rather than just a convenient metaphor.
*   Exploring alternatives like quantum Bayesianism that reconstruct quantum theory without fundamental information postulates.

Overall the key is finding ways to break out of circular self-confirmation and demonstrate the explanatory power of information concepts beyond recapitulating known quantum information phenomena. This requires creative theoretical and experimental work to validate the fruitfulness of information-theoretic paradigms in physics.

There are likely many valid perspectives to handle this key challenge. Identifying and seriously engaging with the concern is an important first step. Finding ways to move beyond circularity is an essential challenge. Ongoing interdisciplinary research will uncover deeper truths.
