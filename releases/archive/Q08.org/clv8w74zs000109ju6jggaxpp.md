Q8 Research is seeking proposals for the development of a free and open-source (FOSS) blockchain protocol specifically designed for content publishing and verifiability. This pilot project aims to empower authors and content creators to freely disseminate their work while ensuring the integrity and authenticity of information.

**Project Objectives:**

_Open and Accessible Publishing_: Develop a protocol that allows authors to publish their work in an open and accessible format, without encryption.

_Verifiable Authorship_: Implement mechanisms for authors to sign their content, establishing ownership and ensuring authenticity.

_Verifiable Content_: Enable readers and researchers to easily verify the integrity of published content through content addressing mechanisms like cryptographic hashes.

_Rich Metadata_: Allow content creators to include metadata and descriptions of their work, facilitating searchability, categorization, and discovery.

_Non-Monetary Incentives_: Defi blockchain this absolutely is not. Leave the wallets to them.

_Scalability and Performance_: Design the protocol with scalability and performance in mind to accommodate a high volume of publishing transactions and support large content text files.

_Headless UI_: Develop user-friendly, minimal, text-based interfaces (assuming a command line prompt is not user-friendly) for web/mobile/dApps to interact with the protocol, freeing content creators to publish and enlightening readers who explore and engage with content.

Iï¿¼nnovative and collaborative approaches to address the challenges of content publishing and verifiability using FOSS blockchain technology are essential. This pilot project aims to foster community-driven development and empower content creators worldwide.
