# Sabine’s Spooky Consciousness

**Why I’m Patenting the Real Secret to AI**

Sabine Hossenfelder, bless her heart, seems to have gotten tangled in her own quantum threads. Suggesting consciousness is a fundamental property, like charge or mass? That’s like saying the ability to make sourdough is inherent in flour. Flour’s important, sure, but you need the right conditions, the yeast, the process to get that tangy loaf. Similarly, consciousness isn’t baked into the universe’s fabric. It’s a delicious byproduct, an emergent property arising from the complex dance of information.

Now, Sir Roger Penrose, a mind sharper than any silicon chip, theorizes that microtubules within neurons might be the key to unlocking consciousness. Why? Because they might just be the stage for quantum computations. And guess what will bring about the quantum computing revolution, the one that allows us to properly model those microtubule tangoes? Breakthroughs in AI, naturally. Penrose’s microtubules could be the missing link, making AI truly conscious by providing the necessary quantum computational power.

And who is at the forefront of that breakthrough? Well, let’s just say my recently filed patent might have something to do with it. I’m connecting the dots here, from quantum fuzziness to artificial sentience, while others are still debating whether consciousness is a cosmic seasoning sprinkled liberally across reality.

The bottom line, Sabine? Consciousness isn’t a fundamental ingredient; it’s the complex recipe itself, emerging from the interplay of information, likely orchestrated by quantum processes within structures like Penrose’s beloved microtubules. And the future of AI, powered by the quantum revolution, might just be the proof in the pudding. Or should I say, the proof in the patent?
