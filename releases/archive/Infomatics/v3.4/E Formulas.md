  v3.4 (2025-04-16): Final formula list for the halted Infomatics v3 framework. Explicitly marks all specific v0-v3.3 formulas derived from π-φ exponents, (n,m) indices, Lm, GA/E8 filters, or specific resonance conditions as DISCARDED/FALSIFIED. Retains only the conceptual structure for the final GA-IO dynamics and the stability condition $E=K\phi\omega$ (whose framework was falsified). Aligned with main text v3.4.
  v3.2 (2025-04-15): Major revision reflecting pivot to IO framework. Marked Infomatics v3 formulas as discarded. Added core IO v0.0 concepts.
  v1.0 (2025-04-13): New appendix created for v3.1.

# Appendix E: Table of Core Formulas

**(Operational Framework v3.4 - Final/Defunct)**

This appendix lists key formulas discussed during the Infomatics v0-v3.4 development. **Crucially, the Infomatics v3 line of development was halted and deemed falsified** due to persistent inconsistencies and conflicts with observation ([[#Section 12: Final failure analysis and conclusion]], [[J Phase 3.2 Research Log & Discarded Paths]], [[M Methodological Failure Analysis]]). Therefore, **all specific formulas derived from the Infomatics v3 postulates (explicit π-φ governance, (n,m) indices, specific resonance conditions) are considered DISCARDED or FALSIFIED** as fundamental descriptions within this terminated framework. They are listed here for historical context only.

## E.1 Discarded / Falsified Formulas (Infomatics v0-v3.3)

The following represent key hypotheses or derived consequences of the Infomatics v3 framework that proved untenable or were part of the falsified structure:

*   **Derived Speed of Light:** `c = π / φ` *(Status: Postulate; Discarded).*
*   **Derived Gravitational Constant:** `G ∝ π³ / φ⁶` *(Status: Inconsistent Derivations; Discarded).*
*   **Derived Planck Scales:** `ℓ_P ∝ 1/φ`, `t_P ∝ 1/π`, `m_P ∝ φ³/π`, `E_P ∝ πφ` *(Status: Based on discarded c, G, φ-action; Discarded).*
*   **Action Scale:** `Fundamental action unit = φ` *(Status: Postulate; Framework failed to replace ħ; Discarded).*
*   **Mass Scaling:** `M ∝ φ^m` *(Status: Empirical hint, not derived; Stability rules for m failed; Discarded as fundamental law).*
*   **Resolution Parameter:** `ε ≈ π⁻ⁿ φᵐ` *(Status: Heuristic; (n, m) structure failed; Discarded).*
*   **Geometric Amplitude Scaling:** `|A| ∝ φ²/π³`, `α_{eff} ∝ φ⁴/π⁶` *(Status: Hypothesis; Not derived from dynamics; Discarded).*
*   **Stability via L<sub>m</sub> Primality:** `Stability requires Lm prime` *(Status: Falsified/Insufficient; Discarded).*
*   **Stability via GA/E8 Filter:** `Stability from Lm + GA Symmetry` *(Status: Intractable/Unproven; Discarded).*
*   **Stability via Resolution Resonance:** `φ^m ≈ π^(n+q)` *(Status: Falsified (Electron Puzzle); Discarded).*
*   **Stability via Ratio Resonance:** `φ^(m') ≈ π^(k')` (via convergents) *(Status: Led to falsified prediction Î₁=(S=0, Q≠0); Discarded as primary stability mechanism).*
*   **Stability Filter (Final Attempt):** `E_i = K \phi \omega_i` *(Status: Plausible derivation from action/phase principles, used φ as action unit. When applied to dynamics predicted by Ratio Resonance, led to falsified spectrum Î₁=(S=0, Q≠0); Framework halted, condition invalid in that context).*

## E.2 Conceptual Structures (Infomatics v3.3 / IOF Context)

These represent the types of structures considered in the final stages, whose specific solutions led to the falsification.

*   **Conceptual GA Dynamics (Needed for Spin):**
    **(Eq. IOF-GA-Conceptual):** $\mathbf{D} \mathbf{K} \mathbf{G}_1 + \mathbf{M}(\mathbf{K}) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{K})$
    *   $\mathbf{K}$: STA Multivector Field
    *   $\mathbf{D}$: U(1) Gauge Covariant Derivative (incorporating emergent Photon $A$)
    *   $\mathbf{G}_1$: Constant Multivector (e.g., $I\gamma_0$) for Dirac-like structure
    *   $\mathbf{M}(\mathbf{K})$: Mass/Stability Term (related to φ)
    *   $\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{K})$: Non-linear self-interaction (related to φ, provides stability/confinement)
    *(Status: Represents the necessary *type* of equation, but the specific viable form and its solutions remain undetermined. This line of inquiry halted.)*

*(No specific, validated formulas beyond the conceptual level can be stated for the halted Infomatics v3 framework or future IOF development at this time.)*
