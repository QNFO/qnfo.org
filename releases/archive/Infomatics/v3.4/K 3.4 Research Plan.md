# Appendix K: Phase 3.4 Research Plan (Obsolete)

**(Operational Framework v3.4 - Final/Defunct)**

## K Introduction

This appendix outlines the quantitative research program (Phase 3.4) that *was* planned following the development of the Infomatics v3.3 theoretical framework based on the Ratio Resonance stability principle. The goal of this phase was to perform the necessary calculations to quantitatively test the framework's predictions against observation.

**However, as documented in the main text ([[#Section 12: Final failure analysis and conclusion]]) and Appendix J ([[J Phase 3.2 Research Log & Discarded Paths]]), the initial theoretical analysis within Phase 3.4 revealed a fundamental conflict between the framework's predictions (specifically, a light charged scalar Î₁) and observation. This led to the falsification and halting of the Infomatics v3 development line.**

Therefore, the research plan detailed below is now **obsolete** and will not be executed. It is preserved here solely for historical documentation of the intended path before the framework was falsified.

## K Obsolete Research Priorities and Tasks (Original Plan for v3.4)

The research was structured around key calculations needed to test the v3.3 framework:

**Priority 1: Calculate Properties of Fundamental States Î₁ & Î₂ (Obsolete)**

*   **Objective:** Rigorously determine Spin (S), Charge (Q), and relative Mass (M₂/M₁) for Î₁ (m'=2, k'=1) and Î₂ (m'=5, k'=2).
*   **Methodology:** Solve the GA-IOF wave equation + stability condition $E_i = \phi \omega_i$. Analyze solutions for S, Q, M.
*   **Status:** Conceptual analysis predicted Î₁=(S=0, Q≠0), Î₂=(S=1/2, Q≠0), M₂/M₁≈π. This prediction led to falsification based on non-observation of Î₁.

**Priority 2: Develop Interaction Model & Estimate Strengths (Obsolete)**

*   **Objective:** Quantify interactions mediated by Î₁, Î₃, Photon. Determine couplings.
*   **Methodology:** Derive vertices from GA dynamics. Calculate Scale Factor SF, $\alpha_{eff}$, $\alpha_{strong}$.
*   **Status:** Not reached due to failure at Priority 1 analysis.

**Priority 3: Model Nucleon Composites (Obsolete)**

*   **Objective:** Demonstrate stable composite nucleons P≈(In⁺In⁺In⁻), N≈(In⁺In⁻Î₁⁰?) form with correct properties. Estimate masses.
*   **Methodology:** Bound-state calculations using derived interactions/constituents.
*   **Status:** Not reached. Preliminary analysis showed potential N-P mass problem even before final falsification.

**Priority 4: Subsequent Calculations (Obsolete)**

*   Model Muon/Tau/Quarks as excitations/composites.
*   Develop Weak Interaction analogue.
*   Derive Emergent Gravity & Cosmology.
*   Calculate precision observables.
*   **Status:** Not reached.

## K Conclusion

The quantitative research plan outlined for Infomatics Phase 3.4 is **obsolete** due to the falsification of the underlying Infomatics v3.3 theoretical framework. Future research requires entirely new foundational approaches, distinct from those pursued in Infomatics v3.
