# Appendix D: Glossary of Terms

**(Operational Framework v3.4 - Final/Defunct)**

This glossary defines key terms used within the Infomatics framework development (v0-v3.4). Many terms associated with specific mechanisms explored in v3.0-v3.2 were found to be part of **discarded hypotheses** ([[J Phase 3.2 Research Log & Discarded Paths]], [[M Methodological Failure Analysis]]). Terms related to the final v3.3 Ratio Resonance model are included, noting the ultimate failure and falsification of that model leading to the halt of the Infomatics v3 project.

*   **Action Scale (φ - Discarded Axiom):**
    *   **Definition (Historical):** In Infomatics v0-v3.1, the Golden Ratio φ was *postulated* as the fundamental unit of action, replacing Planck's constant ħ. The stability condition $E=K\phi\omega$ derived later (v3.3) naturally incorporated φ.
    *   **Status (v3.4):** While φ emerged in the final stability condition, its role as the *sole* action quantum replacing ħ was part of a framework that was ultimately falsified. Its fundamental role remains unproven and this postulate is **discarded**.

*   **Amplitude, Geometric ($\mathcal{A}$):**
    *   **Definition:** The probability amplitude governing interactions/transitions between stable states (Î).
    *   **Status (v3.4):** Intended to be derived from fundamental dynamics, replacing standard couplings. The specific scaling involving π, φ hypothesized in Infomatics v3 ([[A Amplitude]]) was **discarded**. Derivation was not achieved before framework halt.

*   **Continuum:**
    *   **Definition:** The principle that the fundamental substrate of reality ($\mathcal{F}$) is continuous, not inherently discrete.
    *   **Status (v3.4):** Retained as a core principle throughout Infomatics development, though the framework built upon it failed.

*   **Contrast, Potential (κ):**
    *   **Definition:** The latent or inherent **capacity for distinction or difference** existing *within* the fundamental informational medium $\mathcal{F}$.
    *   **Status (v3.4):** Retained conceptually as the potentiality underlying manifestation. Represented by the field variable (e.g., $\mathbf{K}$).

*   **(n, m) Indices (Discarded):**
    *   **Definition (Historical):** Integer indices hypothesized in Infomatics v0-v3.2 to characterize stable resonant states based on cyclical (n, π-related) and scaling (m, φ-related) complexity.
    *   **Status (v3.4):** Framework failed to derive stability rules based on these indices; this specific indexing scheme was **discarded**.

*   **(m', k') Indices (v3.3 - Discarded Framework):**
    *   **Definition (Historical):** Emergent integer indices labeling stable states Î<sub>i</sub> derived from the Ratio Resonance condition $\phi^{m'} \approx \pi^{k'}$, corresponding to convergents of $\ln(\pi)/\ln(\phi)$. m' labeled scaling complexity, k' labeled cyclical complexity.
    *   **Status (v3.4):** Part of the Ratio Resonance model which was ultimately falsified. **Discarded** along with the v3.3 framework.

*   **Emergence:**
    *   **Definition:** The principle that complex structures and phenomena arise dynamically from simpler, underlying rules or a fundamental substrate.
    *   **Status (v3.4):** Central principle retained throughout, though the specific emergent mechanisms explored failed.

*   **Field, Informational ($\mathcal{F}$):**
    *   **Definition:** The fundamental, **continuous medium** representing potentiality. Replaced 'Universal Information Field (I)'. Assumed representable by GA multivector $\mathbf{K}(x,t)$ in final stages.
    *   **Role:** Its intrinsic properties and dynamics determine emergent structures and interactions.

*   **Golden Ratio (φ):**
    *   **Definition:** Fundamental mathematical constant (≈1.618).
    *   **Status (v3.4):** Its role as a *governing principle via specific exponentiation* (as in $M \propto \phi^m$) was **discarded**. Its appearance in the Ratio Resonance condition ($\phi^{m'} \approx \pi^{k'}$) and the stability filter ($E=K\phi\omega$) was central to the final v3.3 model, but that model failed. Its fundamental role remains unproven.

*   **Interaction:**
    *   **Definition:** A dynamic process involving patterns (Î) within $\mathcal{F}$, leading to transitions or manifestation.
    *   **Status (v3.4):** Governed by emergent amplitude $\mathcal{A}$ (calculation not achieved). Interactions (EM, Strong, Weak analogues) needed derivation within a successful framework.

*   **Intrinsic Dynamics:**
    *   **Definition:** The principle that the behavior of $\mathcal{F}$ is governed solely by rules and parameters inherent to the medium itself (e.g., $c_0, \mu, \lambda, \phi$).
    *   **Status (v3.4):** Core principle. Final attempts focused on a non-linear GA wave equation.

*   **L<sub>m</sub> Primality Hypothesis (Discarded):**
    *   **Definition (Historical):** Hypothesis that stability of states indexed by *m* correlated with L<sub>m</sub> primality.
    *   **Status (v3.4):** Failed theoretical derivation; **discarded**.

*   **Manifest Information (Î):**
    *   **Definition:** Observable, resolved patterns or structures that emerge dynamically and stably from potential contrast κ within $\mathcal{F}$ via interaction/resolution ε. In v3.3, identified with stable resonant states Î<sub>i</sub>.
    *   **Role:** Represents the actualized, persistent "entities" of the theory.

*   **Oscillon:**
    *   **Definition (Physics Term):** Long-lived (metastable), periodic, localized solution in non-linear scalar field theories.
    *   **Status (v3.4):** Emerged as candidate for Î₁ in minimal scalar IO model, but model was insufficient. GA Q-ball analogue considered for v3.3 Î₁.

*   **Pi (π):**
    *   **Definition:** Fundamental mathematical constant related to cycles.
    *   **Status (v3.4):** Role likely remains significant in describing cyclical aspects (frequency ω, phase, geometry), appeared in Ratio Resonance condition. Its *governing role via specific exponentiation* was **discarded**.

*   **Ratio Resonance Stability (v3.3 Hypothesis - Falsified):**
    *   **Definition (Historical):** Stability principle for v3.3. Required optimal balance $\phi^{m'} \approx \pi^{k'}$. Selected states Î<sub>i</sub> labeled by convergent pairs (m', k').
    *   **Status (v3.4):** Led to prediction of unobserved light charged scalar Î₁; **falsified and discarded**.

*   **Resolution (ε):**
    *   **Definition:** Characteristic ability of an interaction process to distinguish patterns within $\mathcal{F}$. Manifestation depends on ε.
    *   **Status (v3.4):** Retained as crucial concept. Specific mathematical form needs derivation from a successful interaction model. v3 formula $\varepsilon \approx \pi^{-n}\phi^m$ **discarded**.

*   **Resonance:**
    *   **Definition:** General principle that stable states Î correspond to persistent, self-reinforcing dynamic patterns within $\mathcal{F}$.
    *   **Status (v3.4):** Retained conceptually. Specific resonance conditions explored (Direct π-φ, Resolution, Ratio) were **discarded** as primary stability principles. Stability must arise directly from dynamics.

*   **Stability:**
    *   **Definition:** Property allowing an emergent pattern Î to persist.
    *   **Status (v3.4):** Must arise dynamically from governing equations. The v3.3 condition $E=K\phi\omega$ was the final candidate filter, derived from action/phase principles, but the overall framework failed. Previous criteria (L<sub>m</sub>, GA/E8 filter) **discarded**.

*   **Structure First (Methodology):**
    *   **Definition:** Principle: Derive stable emergent structures first from dynamics, calculate properties, then compare to observation. Avoid *a priori* numerical targets.
    *   **Status (v3.4):** Adopted methodology during late Phase 3.2 / v3.3, ultimately leading to framework falsification. Remains a sound principle for future work.
