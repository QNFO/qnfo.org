# The Blueprint of Our Lives

## Part 2: Interrogating the Present

>  “What is the blueprint of your life?”

This profound interrogative, posed by **Martin Luther King Jr.**, serves as a starting point for a deeper inquiry, a journey into the heart of existence itself. We have previously explored this “blueprint” as a metaphor for our inherent talents, limitations, and the dynamic interplay between predetermination and possibility within the context of an *informational universe*. We have considered how societal structures and personal choices shape the edifice of our lives. But now, inspired by John Archibald Wheeler’s “it from bit” concept, let us embark on a more radical exploration. Let us conceive of the universe as a vast, computational entity, fundamentally built from discrete bits of information, where reality itself emerges from the answers to yes-no questions. And, more importantly, let us view ourselves not merely as passive recipients of a predetermined fate, but as *skilled interrogators* of this informational universe, actively participating in the unfolding of our own blueprints. This essay, then, is not just an exploration, but an *instruction manual*—a guide for learning to pose the right questions to the universe, for discerning the answers, and for building lives of meaning and purpose within the framework of our inherent potential.

King, in his address, alluded to an “architect” who meticulously draws a blueprint. If we adopt the “it from bit” perspective, this “architect” is not a separate entity, but the fundamental process of the universe itself, where existence arises from the interplay of binary choices. The blueprint, then, is not a pre-drawn map, but an emergent property of the universe’s ongoing computation, a pattern arising from অসংখ্য (countless) yes-no answers to fundamental questions at the quantum level.

Our universe, in its vastness and complexity, can be understood as a colossal information processing system. Every interaction, every event, from the smallest quantum fluctuation to the largest galactic structure, can be described in terms of information exchange and processing. This “*informational universe*” is not merely a collection of physical objects but a dynamic interplay of information patterns, where reality emerges from the answers to fundamental yes-no questions.

> If reality is fundamentally “it from bit” - if existence arises from information - then our individual blueprints are not static plans, but dynamically evolving informational structures within this cosmic computation.

This perspective aligns with the insights of modern physics, particularly quantum mechanics, which reveals a cosmos fundamentally connected through informational exchange. King’s assertion of inherent equality, a principle drawn from the Declaration of Independence, resonates with this perspective: all beings share a common origin within this informational matrix, interconnected through the fundamental bits that constitute their existence.

> Just as the universe operates according to underlying physical laws—laws that can be understood as algorithms processing information—so too, King posited, does it operate according to moral laws, intrinsic principles of justice and equality that are woven into the very fabric of reality, and which we can potentially discern through careful observation and questioning.

Within this informational universe, each individual blueprint is a unique sequence of bits, a particular set of answers to the universe’s fundamental questions. These answers determine our genetic predispositions, inherent talents, and even the initial conditions of our lives. Societal structures, much like algorithms in a computer program, can either facilitate or constrain the unfolding of our individual blueprints, influencing the informational input we receive.

>  Being born into a lower socioeconomic stratum can be likened to having a set of initial conditions in the program that limit access to certain informational pathways, hindering the full development of the blueprint’s potential.

My own pursuit of higher education became a conscious effort to pose a specific question to the universe: “Can I, despite the initial constraints of my blueprint, access and process new information to expand my potential?” The universe, through a series of events and opportunities, answered in the affirmative.

> This leads us to the core of Wheeler’s concept: we are not passive observers but active participants in the universe’s unfolding. Our questions, our choices, shape the very reality we experience.

We are, in a sense, programmers within this vast cosmic computer, constantly posing questions through our actions and intentions. But how do we know if we are asking the *right* questions? How do we discern if we are on the path aligned with our blueprint, the path that allows us to build the best possible structure within the framework of our inherent potential? This is where the art of *interrogation* becomes paramount.

**And this is also where we must acknowledge the profound implications of *chaos theory*.** This branch of mathematics and physics reveals that within complex, dynamic systems—and the informational universe surely qualifies—even minute changes in initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes. The proverbial butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil and causing a tornado in Texas is a vivid, though perhaps oversimplified, illustration of this principle.

**What this means for us, as conscious agents within the informational universe, is that every action we take, no matter how seemingly small or insignificant, has the potential to create cascading ripple effects that extend far beyond our immediate awareness.** Every choice we make, every question we pose, is like a tiny nudge to the system, a perturbation in the initial conditions. These seemingly insignificant actions are amplified by chaos, just like a whisper in a canyon can echo and reverberate into a roar, or how a spark in dry brush can ignite a massive wildfire. We may not be able to predict the precise outcome of these ripples, but we must be aware that they exist and that they can fundamentally alter the trajectory of our lives and the unfolding of events around us. This underscores the profound interconnectedness of all things within the informational universe and the immense responsibility we bear as conscious actors within it. Each flap of the butterfly’s wings, each small action, can be the start of an entirely new reality. Chaos theory, therefore, is not about randomness, but about inherent unpredictability due to interconnectedness. This doesn’t mean our choices are meaningless, rather, it highlights their profound importance, as even small actions can have large, unforeseen consequences as the universe processes them. Therefore, every choice, every action, however small, is a significant interaction with the universe, a question posed that will be answered, a thread added to the tapestry that will influence its overall pattern.

Is it, as Freud suggested, through synchronicity—meaningful coincidences that seem to defy mere chance? Are these synchronicities the universe’s way of answering “yes” to the questions we are implicitly asking through our desires and intentions? Freud’s exploration of the unconscious mind laid the groundwork for understanding how our internal states can influence our perception of the external world. **Building upon this, the concept of *manifestation*, popular in various new age and self-help movements, takes this idea a step further, suggesting that our focused thoughts, beliefs, and intentions can actively shape our reality.** While often presented in a simplified or overly literal way, at its core, manifestation touches upon a fundamental truth within the “it from bit” framework: information patterns influence the unfolding of events.

**From the perspective of the informational universe, manifestation can be interpreted as a form of focused interrogation.** By consciously directing our attention and intention towards a desired outcome, we are, in effect, posing a specific question to the universe: “Can this become reality?” The intensity of our focus, the clarity of our intention, and the emotional energy we invest in the question can be seen as amplifying the signal, increasing the probability of receiving a “yes” in the form of events, opportunities, and synchronicities that align with our desired outcome. However, it’s crucial to remember that manifestation, like any form of interaction with the universe, is subject to the principles of chaos theory and the limitations of our individual blueprints. It is not about controlling the universe, but about aligning ourselves with its inherent potential and working within the framework of its fundamental laws. It is about posing questions effectively and being receptive to the answers, however they may manifest. While the universe may respond to our focused intention, the “how” and “when” are often beyond our direct control. The universe operates on vast timescales and intricate interconnectedness that we may not fully grasp. Therefore, manifestation is not a magic formula for instant gratification, but rather a way of participating more consciously in the ongoing dance of creation within the informational universe.

**What do these yes-no questions look like in practice?** They are often less about seeking specific answers and more about aligning ourselves with the informational flow of the universe. Here are some examples:

-   **Instead of asking “What job should I take?” we can ask:**
    -   “Does this opportunity align with my core values?” (Yes/No)
    -   “Does this path allow me to utilize my inherent talents?” (Yes/No)
    -   “Does this choice contribute to my overall growth and development?” (Yes/No)
-   **Instead of asking “Why is this bad thing happening to me?” we can ask:**
    -   “Is there a lesson I can learn from this challenge?” (Yes/No)
    -   “Does this obstacle present an opportunity for growth?” (Yes/No)
    -   “Is this situation prompting me to re-evaluate my current path?” (Yes/No)
-   **Instead of asking “Will I be successful?” we can ask:**
    -   “Am I acting in accordance with my deepest values?” (Yes/No)
    -   “Am I making the best use of my talents and resources?” (Yes/No)
    -   “Am I open to the feedback the universe is providing?” (Yes/No)

> The answers to these questions are not always immediate or obvious. They may manifest as synchronicities, intuitive nudges, or unexpected opportunities.

**Synchronicity**, as envisioned by Jung, can be reframed as the universe’s way of providing “yes” answers to our implicit questions. These meaningful coincidences are not mere chance, but informational patterns aligning, signaling that we are on the right track. For instance, repeatedly encountering a particular symbol, idea, or person might be the universe affirming a particular line of inquiry or a chosen path.

For example, when King spoke of doors of opportunity opening, was he not describing a form of universal feedback, a “yes” to the collective striving for equality and justice? When he spoke of a *pronoic* universe, was he not intuiting an underlying algorithm that favors progress and the unfolding of potential? Perhaps the feeling of being “on the right path” is itself a form of feedback, a subtle resonance between our individual informational structure and the larger informational structure of the universe. It’s a feeling of alignment, of flow, where our actions seem to generate positive responses, where opportunities arise, and where we experience a sense of purpose and meaning.

Conversely, feelings of being lost, stuck, or unfulfilled might be interpreted as a “no” from the universe, a signal that we are asking the wrong questions or pursuing paths that diverge from our blueprint’s inherent design. The challenges we face, the obstacles we encounter, can also be viewed as informational feedback, prompting us to re-evaluate our questions and refine our approach.

> The “it from bit” perspective suggests that we are constantly engaged in a dialogue with the universe, a process of posing questions and receiving answers, often in subtle and unexpected ways.

Our free will lies in the questions we choose to ask, the intentions we set, and how we interpret the yes-no answers we receive. We can ask questions like: “Is this action aligned with my values?” “Does this path lead to growth and fulfillment?” “Am I contributing to the greater good?” The answers may come in the form of synchronicities, intuitions, opportunities, or even challenges that force us to re-evaluate.

King’s life can be viewed through this lens as well. His unwavering commitment to justice, his expressed acceptance of his mortality—were these not a series of questions posed to the universe? Questions like: “Is this the path I am meant to follow?” (Yes). “Is the cause of justice worth any sacrifice?” (Yes). “Am I ready to accept whatever consequences may come?” (Yes). And did not the universe answer, with a significant “yes,” amplifying his message and galvanizing a movement?

> It is crucial to understand that events, even those we perceive as negative or tragic, can hold profound meaning within the larger informational context.

King’s death was not simply a tragedy; it was a powerful informational event that resonated throughout the collective consciousness. Just as the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, often framed as a sacrifice for humanity’s sins, became a pivotal moment in the Christian narrative, King’s death became a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement. These events, while undeniably painful, served as powerful catalysts for change, demonstrating the profound interconnectedness of actions and consequences within the informational universe. They became focal points, attracting and amplifying information, ultimately shifting the informational landscape.

> But what of the most challenging question of all—the question of whether we can choose to terminate our blueprint’s unfolding, to opt out of the cosmic computation through suicide?

My own experience, having once intervened to save a woman’s life in the Tenderloin neighborhood of San Francisco, an area deeply affected by the opioid crisis, has led me to ponder this very question. If the universe is indeed an informational construct, governed by an underlying order, can it even permit the ultimate act of self-negation, the complete cessation of information flow that is a human life, at least in its current form? Is there a sense in which the blueprint, once initiated, must play out in some way, even if the individual within it struggles or seeks to exit the stage prematurely?

> These are not questions with easy answers. They touch upon the deepest mysteries of existence, the nature of consciousness, and the limits of free will.

What we can say, however, is that the blueprint is not merely a passive document. It is a dynamic, evolving entity, constantly being shaped by our choices, our actions, and the information we choose to engage with. King’s message was not about romanticizing menial labor. It was about recognizing the inherent worth and dignity of *all* work and the power of individual agency to transform even the most seemingly mundane tasks into expressions of excellence through conscious engagement with the informational universe.

> It was about building, even if the materials seem limited, even if the initial design seems constrained by lack of access to information.

Importantly, King’s message also hinted at a *pronoic* nature inherent within the universe—a subtle, underlying force that bends towards progress and opportunity. When he spoke to the students at Barrett Junior High, he acknowledged the injustices they faced, yet he also emphasized a crucial point: “*...doors are opening to you—doors of opportunities that were not open to your mothers and your fathers — and the great challenge facing you is to be ready to face these doors as they open.*”

> This suggests a belief in a universe that, despite its flaws and challenges, offers a trajectory towards greater possibilities.

It’s a perspective that aligns with the concept of a *pronoic* universe—a universe that, in its grand unfolding, tends towards growth, expansion, and the realization of potential. This doesn’t negate the existence of suffering or injustice, but it suggests that within the informational fabric of reality, there’s an underlying current that favors progress, if we are willing to recognize and seize the opportunities presented to us, working diligently within our blueprints. This pronoic tendency can be seen as an inherent characteristic of the informational universe itself—a universe that expands, evolves, and complexifies over time, generating ever-new possibilities for growth and development.

This awareness of life’s fragility, coupled with an understanding of a potentially pronoic universe underscores the importance of living with intention, of building upon our blueprints with purpose and urgency, recognizing that the time we have is finite in our current form and precious, and that the information we choose to engage with shapes the very structure of our lives.

> In conclusion, let us understand the blueprint of our lives not as a static, predetermined fate but as a dynamic and evolving informational design, a foundation upon which we build, influenced by societal forces yet ultimately shaped by our own choices and actions, particularly our choices about what information to *গ্রহণ* (accept), process, and act upon.

We are not merely passive recipients of a destiny etched in stone or encoded in a fixed informational pattern; we are active participants in the construction of our lives, constantly learning, adapting, and refining our understanding of our blueprint and the universe around us through the dynamic exchange of information. At any given time, we are building the best building we know how to, even if we don’t fully understand the complete blueprint or the universe’s ultimate plan.

> The journey of building our lives is a lifelong process of discovery and creation, a continuous unfolding of the potential held within our unique blueprints.

As we strive to build our best selves, let us embrace our role as *skilled interrogators* of the informational universe. Let us remember Dr. King’s potent question, not as a passive inquiry, but as an active challenge, a call to engage with the universe, to pose meaningful questions, and to discern the answers that illuminate our path.

> We are the architects of our own becoming, entrusted with the profound responsibility and exhilarating opportunity to build lives of meaning, purpose, and lasting impact within the grand tapestry of the informational universe.

Each decision we make, each action we take, each piece of information we engage with, is a question posed to the universe, a brushstroke on the canvas of our lives, a brick laid in the edifice of our existence. Let us, therefore, choose our questions wisely, listen attentively to the universe’s responses—be they in the form of synchronicities, challenges, or intuitive nudges—and strive to create lives that are not only successful but also meaningful, fulfilling, and a testament to the extraordinary potential that resides within each and every one of us, a potential that is realized through our active participation in the dynamic flow of information that constitutes the universe itself. The elephant of our ineffable truth is revealed not in its entirety, but bit by bit, through the continuous and conscious interrogation of the universe itself. Let our interrogation begin.
