# The Blueprint of Our Lives

## Part 1: Learning from the Past

> “What is the blueprint of your life?”

This profound interrogative, posed by **Martin Luther King Jr.** to the students of Barratt Junior High in 1967, transcends the simplicity of its phrasing. It is not merely a question but an invitation—an urgent call to delve into the very essence of human potential, purpose, and the intricate tapestry of existence. This essay embarks on an exploration of that very “*blueprint,*” a metaphor that encapsulates our inherent talents, limitations, and the dynamic interplay between predetermination and possibility within the context of an *informational universe*. It will examine how this blueprint, conceived not by a literal divine architect but through the complex interplay of genetics, environment, and chance, interacts with the scaffolding of societal structures and the hammer of personal choices, ultimately shaping the edifice of our existence. We will even dare to explore a more provocative question: can we, through our choices, fundamentally alter or even terminate our blueprint’s unfolding, and what are the implications of such an act within the informational framework of the universe?

> King, in his address, alluded to an “architect” who meticulously draws a blueprint before any building can be erected. “*Whenever a building is constructed,*” he stated, “*you usually have an architect who draws a blueprint, and that blueprint serves as the pattern, as the guide...Now each of you is in the process of building the structure of your lives, and the question is whether you have a proper, a solid and a sound blueprint.*”

However, to interpret this architect as a conscious, personal deity is to limit the scope of his metaphor. Rather, the “architect” can be understood as the architecture of existence itself—the intricate dance of natural forces, biological processes, and the fundamental principles governing the universe, particularly the principles that underpin the *informational universe*. The blueprint, therefore, is not a rigid, immutable decree from a divine hand but rather an emergent design, a pattern arising from the confluence of countless informational interactions. It is akin to an architect’s initial sketch, outlining the basic structure, yet leaving ample room for modification, expansion, and even radical renovation. This inherent design, this *informational blueprint*, precedes the “building“—the lived experience of our lives. We, as the builders, are then endowed with the agency to construct our lives based on that initial design, making the best use of its inherent potential.

Our universe, in its vastness and complexity, can be understood as an intricate network of information, a superstrata where data flows, interacts, and interweaves, shaping reality itself. This “*informational universe*” is not merely a collection of physical objects but a dynamic interplay of information patterns. Every atom, every molecule, every interaction, can be described in terms of information. From this perspective, our individual blueprints are complex *informational structures*, encoded in our DNA, shaped by epigenetic influences, and constantly updated through our interactions with the environment.

> This “informational universe” is characterized by an underlying order and interconnectedness.

Modern physics, particularly the mind-bending realm of quantum mechanics, reveals a cosmos where everything is fundamentally connected, where seemingly disparate entities are entangled in complex and often inexplicable ways, all through informational exchange. Similarly, King’s assertion of inherent equality, a principle he drew from the Declaration of Independence, suggests a universe where all beings, despite their apparent differences, share a common origin and are bound by a fundamental interconnectedness—an *informational interconnectedness*.

> Just as the universe operates according to underlying physical laws—the laws of thermodynamics, gravity, electromagnetism—so too, King posited, does it operate according to moral laws, intrinsic principles of justice and equality that are woven into the very fabric of reality, transmitted and upheld through the flow of information.

Within this informational universe, each individual possesses a unique blueprint—a complex interplay of genetic predispositions, inherent talents, early life experiences, and the continuous influx of information absorbed from the environment. As King said to the students, “*You are deciding on what you will be in life,*” but the informational perspective suggests this decision-making happens within the context of an already existing informational framework. This blueprint is the foundation upon which we build, defining our starting point, our potential, and, indeed, our initial limitations.

> Societal structures, much like the scaffolding that surrounds a building under construction, can either provide support or impose constraints on the realization of our individual blueprints.

King often reiterated the fundamental truth, enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, that “*all men are created equal*.” However, this noble ideal was, and often still is, starkly contradicted by the lived experiences of many, particularly African Americans facing the brutal realities of segregation and systemic racism. This principle of equality, King argued, was not a gift bestowed by earthly powers but an inherent right, a reflection of a deeper, spiritual truth about human existence.

> He emphasized that these rights are “*endowed by their Creator,*” suggesting a universal principle of inherent worth and dignity that transcends social constructs and arbitrary hierarchies and is embedded within the informational fabric of the universe.

Consider, for example, the historical anathema of the Indian caste system, a rigid social hierarchy that attempted to preordain an individual’s role and potential from the moment of birth, often in flagrant disregard of their individual blueprint. It was a societal imposition that sought to override individual potential, confining individuals to predetermined roles based solely on the circumstances of their birth, restricting the flow of information that could actualize their potential. Similarly, socioeconomic status can profoundly impact access to resources and opportunities, influencing the informational input individuals receive.

> Being born into a lower socioeconomic stratum can feel like starting with a less detailed or more constrained blueprint, with fewer rooms and narrower hallways, due to limited access to enriching information.

For instance, children born into the lowest income quintile have a mere *7.5%* chance of reaching the top income quintile as adults, a stark illustration of the intergenerational limitations imposed by socioeconomic circumstances, a restriction on the potential for informational growth. The median wealth of white households is nearly *10 times* that of Black households and more than *8 times* that of Hispanic households, further highlighting the enduring legacy of systemic inequalities that create informational disparities. Even in areas like education and employment, disparities persist. As of 2022, while *61%* of Asian adults and *42%* of white adults held a bachelor’s degree or higher, only *28%* of Black adults and *21%* of Hispanic adults had achieved the same level of education—a disparity directly related to the quality and quantity of information accessible to different groups. The unemployment and poverty rates also reveal significant disparities, with individuals with disabilities experiencing an employment rate of only *21.3%* compared to *65.4%* for those without disabilities, and a poverty rate of *25.7%* compared to *11.4%*, illustrating the societal barriers that limit access to both material and informational resources. These statistics underscore how societal structures can create formidable barriers to realizing one’s full potential by restricting or distorting the flow of information.

> My own pursuit of higher education, a path not readily paved for those of my background, became a conscious and deliberate effort to work within the inherent possibilities of my blueprint, to add rooms and stories to the initial design, to build upwards and outwards, navigating the perceived limitations of the foundation by actively seeking out and absorbing new information.

However, societal structures can also foster *internalized limitations*, leading individuals to accept the constraints imposed upon them as defining their entire potential, never fully realizing the breadth and depth of their inherent design because they are not exposed to information that challenges these limitations.

> While acknowledging the influence of both the predetermined blueprint and the often-constraining societal structures, it is crucial to emphasize that these factors do not irrevocably dictate our destiny.

We are not mere automatons, passively enacting a predetermined script. We possess agency—the capacity to make conscious choices, to learn, to grow, to adapt, and to evolve, primarily through the active seeking and processing of information. This is where the concept of “*bending*” reality through information becomes paramount. By understanding the principles of the informational universe, through rigorous scientific inquiry, introspective reflection, and mindful action, we can make choices that align with our blueprint and maximize our potential, even if we don’t fully comprehend the entire design.

> This is not about defying the fundamental laws of physics, but rather about working skillfully within them, utilizing the information at our disposal to navigate the complexities of existence with greater awareness and intentionality.

It is about recognizing that we are not just passive recipients of information but active agents who can seek out, interpret, and utilize information to reshape our realities, working within the parameters of our individual blueprints. As King urged, we must “*develop and maintain the capacity to forgive,*” understanding that forgiveness itself is an informational process, a reframing of past events.

> My own life stands as a testament to this very principle. By consciously choosing to work within the blueprint presented to me, seeking out new information and experiences, I have constructed my reality, albeit unconsciously many times, shaping a life that aligns with my inherent potential, even when that potential was not fully clear to me.

This journey underscores the transformative power of agency and informed choices, the ability to add wings to the initial design, to soar beyond perceived limitations, to reach heights previously unimagined by actively engaging with the informational universe, always striving to make the best use of the blueprint I was given. This process, however, is not without its challenges. It demands unwavering effort, relentless perseverance, and a willingness to confront and overcome obstacles, both internal and external.

> It is in this striving, this constant striving for excellence, as Dr. King so eloquently urged, “*If it falls your lot to be a street sweeper, sweep streets like Michelangelo painted pictures,*” that we truly begin to realize the potential encoded within our blueprints.

> As King exhorted the students at Barratt Junior High, “*Now each of you is in the process of building the structure of your lives, and the question is whether you have a proper, a solid and a sound blueprint.*”

Admittedly, King’s language here implies a choice in *having* a blueprint, a seeming contradiction to the idea of an inherent design. However, his overarching message, delivered with the fervor of a preacher and the passion of an activist, suggests that we *all* possess inherent potentials and limitations—a blueprint, regardless of whether we acknowledge it. King, speaking to inspire and ignite the imaginations of his young audience, prioritized emotional connection and motivational impact over strict logical consistency.

> The crucial choice, he implies, lies not in *having* a blueprint but in our conscious decision of how to *build* upon it, how to translate that inherent potential into tangible reality, how actively we engage with the informational flow around us.

He wiggles a bit here, suggesting the students *choose* to have a sound blueprint, but the underlying logic implies the *blueprint precedes the building*, and the blueprint is fundamentally an informational construct.

> One of the most insidious challenges in realizing our potential lies in the seductive trap of self-limiting labels.

Labels, whether based on nationality, disability, race, socioeconomic status, or any other external categorization, can all too easily become self-fulfilling prophecies, constricting our potential by narrowing our focus and restricting our choices, limiting the informational input we deem relevant. We become, in a sense, what we tell ourselves we are, what others tell us we are, and what society expects us to be, based on limited information. However, we possess the power to define ourselves beyond these often-arbitrary labels.

> Our blueprint is far more complex, nuanced, and multifaceted than any single label can capture.

Free will, that fundamental capacity for autonomous choice, allows us to choose which aspects of our blueprint we identify with and which we choose to transcend, always working to build the best structure we can within its framework. We can embrace challenges not as insurmountable obstacles but as opportunities for growth, redefining our perceived limitations as starting points for innovation and creative problem-solving by seeking out information that contradicts these limiting labels. Consider, for example, the label “*disabled*.” While it acknowledges a specific physical or mental reality, it need not define the entirety of an individual’s potential. A disability can be viewed not as a constraint but as a unique aspect of one’s blueprint, offering different perspectives, fostering resilience, and opening up avenues for innovation that might otherwise remain unexplored, if one is open to receiving and processing this broader range of information.

> The blueprint, therefore, is not a static, unchanging document but a dynamic and evolving design, constantly being updated by new information.

King’s own life, tragically cut short by an assassin’s bullet, serves as both an inspiration and a poignant reminder of the fragility of life and the urgency of purpose. His foreshadowing of his own demise in his “*I’ve Been to the Mountaintop*” speech, delivered just the day before his death, where he spoke of having “*seen the promised land,*” adds another layer of depth to this exploration. It reveals a life lived with profound awareness of its own temporality, a life dedicated to a cause larger than itself. He stated, in that same speech, “*Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I’m not concerned about that now. I just want to do God’s will. And He’s allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I’ve looked over. And I’ve seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land!*”

> And so this begs the question: did King, in expressing his lack of concern for longevity and his readiness to fulfill his purpose, however short-lived, influence the unfolding of events that led to his death?

It raises a provocative consideration within the framework of the informational universe. Did his words, his expressed acceptance of his potential demise, become a self-fulfilling prophecy, an informational signal that, however unintentionally, contributed to the tragic outcome? This is not to suggest that he was responsible for his own death, but rather to explore the complex interplay between our intentions, our words, and the unfolding of events in a universe governed by information. His death, a devastating loss, also became a powerful catalyst, galvanizing the Civil Rights Movement and leading to what was described as the FBI’s most extensive manhunt. In a sense, the information pattern of his life, even in its abrupt ending, continued to resonate and generate profound consequences.

> This leads us to a deeper, more unsettling question: can we choose to leave our buildings unfinished? Can we, through an act of will, choose not to fulfill the potential encoded within our blueprints?

This question becomes particularly complex when considering the act of suicide. My own experience, having once intervened to save a woman’s life in the Tenderloin neighborhood of San Francisco, an area deeply affected by the opioid crisis, has led me to ponder this very question. If the universe is indeed an informational construct, governed by an underlying order, can it even permit the ultimate act of self-negation, the complete cessation of information flow that is a human life? Is there a sense in which the blueprint, once initiated, must play out, even if the individual within it struggles or seeks to exit the stage prematurely?

> These are not questions with easy answers. They touch upon the deepest mysteries of existence, the nature of consciousness, and the limits of free will.

What we can say, however, is that the blueprint is not merely a passive document. It is a dynamic, evolving entity, constantly being shaped by our choices, our actions, and the information we choose to engage with. King’s message was not about romanticizing menial labor. It was about recognizing the inherent worth and dignity of *all* work and the power of individual agency to transform even the most seemingly mundane tasks into expressions of excellence through conscious engagement with the informational universe.

> It was about building, even if the materials seem limited, even if the initial design seems constrained by lack of access to information.

Importantly, King’s message also hinted at a *pronoic* nature inherent within the universe—a subtle, underlying force that bends towards progress and opportunity. When he spoke to the students at Barratt Junior High, he acknowledged the injustices they faced, yet he also emphasized a crucial point: “*...doors are opening to you—doors of opportunities that were not open to your mothers and your fathers — and the great challenge facing you is to be ready to face these doors as they open.*”

> This suggests a belief in a universe that, despite its flaws and challenges, offers a trajectory towards greater possibilities.

It’s a perspective that aligns with the concept of a *pronoic* universe—a universe that, in its grand unfolding, tends towards growth, expansion, and the realization of potential. This doesn’t negate the existence of suffering or injustice, but it suggests that within the informational fabric of reality, there’s an underlying current that favors progress, if we are willing to recognize and seize the opportunities presented to us, working diligently within our blueprints. This pronoic tendency can be seen as an inherent characteristic of the informational universe itself—a universe that expands, evolves, and complexifies over time, generating ever-new possibilities for growth and development.

This awareness of life’s fragility, coupled with an understanding of a potentially pronoic universe underscores the importance of living with intention, of building upon our blueprints with purpose and urgency, recognizing that the time we have is finite and precious, and that the information we choose to engage with shapes the very structure of our lives.

> In conclusion, the blueprint of our lives is not a static, predetermined fate but a dynamic and evolving informational design, a foundation upon which we build, influenced by societal forces yet ultimately shaped by our own choices and actions, particularly our choices about what information to *গ্রহণ* (accept), process, and act upon.

We are not merely passive recipients of a destiny etched in stone or encoded in a fixed informational pattern; we are active participants in the construction of our lives, constantly learning, adapting, and refining our understanding of our blueprint and the universe around us through the dynamic exchange of information. At any given time, we are building the best building we know how to, even if we don’t fully understand the complete blueprint or the universe’s ultimate plan.

> The journey of building our lives is a lifelong process of discovery and creation, a continuous unfolding of the potential held within our unique blueprints.

As we strive to build our best selves, let us remember Dr. King’s potent question, a question that echoes through time, urging us to consider the blueprint of our lives and the legacy we choose to leave behind. We are the architects of our own becoming, entrusted with the profound responsibility and exhilarating opportunity to build lives of meaning, purpose, and lasting impact within the grand tapestry of the informational universe.

> Each decision we make, each action we take, each piece of information we engage with, is a brushstroke on the canvas of our lives, a brick laid in the edifice of our existence.

Let us, therefore, choose wisely, build with intention, seek out enriching information, and strive to create lives that are not only successful by conventional standards but also meaningful, fulfilling, and a testament to the extraordinary potential that resides within each and every one of us, a potential that is realized through our active participation in the dynamic flow of information that constitutes the universe itself. And let us also grapple with the profound and unsettling questions about the limits of our agency, the potential consequences of our choices, and the enduring mystery of existence within this vast and intricate informational cosmos.
