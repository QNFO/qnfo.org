# The Blueprint of Our Lives

## Part 3: Weaving the Future

>  “What is the blueprint of your life?” (Martin Luther King, Jr.)

Having explored the foundations of our individual blueprints within the informational universe, and having learned to interrogate the present through the art of binary questions, we now turn our gaze towards the future—not as a fixed destination, but as a dynamic and ever-evolving tapestry woven from the threads of the past, present, and the infinite possibilities that lie ahead. We transition from the metaphor of a static blueprint to the more fluid and dynamic image of a tapestry, constantly being woven, thread by thread, through our interactions with the informational universe.

In Part 1, we established the concept of the blueprint, drawing upon historical context and the wisdom of figures like Dr. King to understand the interplay of inherent potential and societal forces. In Part 2, we delved into the practical application of Wheeler’s “it from bit” principle, learning to pose yes-no questions to the universe and interpret its responses through synchronicities, intuition, and the unfolding of events around us. Now, in Part 3, we integrate these understandings to build a framework for navigating the future, recognizing that it is not predetermined, but rather co-created through our ongoing dialogue with the universe.

Our past experiences, the “threads” of our individual and collective histories, provide the initial patterns in this tapestry. These patterns are not immutable, but they offer valuable information, encoded within the informational universe as a series of yes-no answers to past questions. By understanding these patterns, we gain insight into the tendencies and probabilities that shape our present.

> The present moment is where the weaving actively takes place. It is here that we, as conscious agents, pose new questions to the universe through our choices, actions, and intentions. Each “yes” or “no” from the universe, each synchronicity, each challenge, each opportunity, adds a new thread to the tapestry, altering its design in subtle or significant ways.

But what of the future? Here, the concept of linear time, as we commonly perceive it, begins to dissolve. Instead of a straight line extending from the past through the present and into the future, we can envision time as a non-linear thread, constantly being woven into the fabric of the informational universe. Furthermore, the very notion of a *single* future must be re-evaluated.

This is where the insights of modern physics, particularly the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, become profoundly relevant. Instead of a single, deterministic future, quantum mechanics suggests a *multiverse* of possibilities, a constantly branching tree of realities where every quantum measurement, every yes-no answer at the fundamental level, causes the universe to split into multiple versions, each representing a different outcome.

> While the many-worlds interpretation remains a subject of debate among physicists, it offers a powerful metaphor for understanding the nature of potentiality. It suggests that the future is not a fixed path, but a vast and ever-expanding landscape of possibilities, a branching network of potential timelines.

If we apply this concept to our tapestry metaphor, we can envision each thread not as a single strand extending into the future, but as a branching point, constantly splitting into multiple threads, each representing a different possible outcome. The tapestry, then, becomes a multi-dimensional, fractal-like structure, embodying the infinite potential inherent within the informational universe. This fractal nature of reality, with its self-similarity across scales, suggests a deep interconnectedness between the different levels of existence, from the quantum realm to the vast expanse of the cosmos. It hints at an underlying order, an informational coherence that permeates all things. Just as a fractal pattern repeats itself at different magnifications, so too might the fundamental principles of the informational universe manifest in similar ways within our individual blueprints, in the evolution of societies, and in the unfolding of the cosmos. It is crucial to emphasize that these are not yet fully formed, but rather exist as *potentialities*, as informational possibilities within the quantum realm.

> The Planck constant (h) plays a crucial role in this understanding. It represents the smallest possible unit of energy, and by extension, the smallest possible unit of action in the universe. **This “quantization” of action suggests that, at the most fundamental level, the universe operates in discrete steps, not continuous flows.**

The Planck constant, therefore, defines the “resolution” of the informational universe, the smallest “pixel” size of reality. This is relevant to us because it implies that our reality is not infinitely divisible. It operates on a fundamental, albeit incredibly small, level of discreteness. This gives weight to the idea that our reality is composed of finite bits of information, similar to pixels on a screen, as opposed to being a smooth, infinitely detailed continuum.

Therefore, the future is not something that passively happens *to* us. It is something we actively *participate* in creating, through the questions we pose, the choices we make, and the information we engage with. Each decision, each action, is a point of divergence, a branching of the tapestry, where one set of possibilities becomes actualized while others remain in the realm of potential. It is important to state that these potentialities haven’t yet happened. They represent a range of possible futures based on the current state of the universe but are not guaranteed to occur.

> We do possess a degree of foresight, an ability to anticipate the future based on our understanding of the past and present. This is where the human capacity for *forecasting* comes into play, and it is surprisingly powerful, even in its simplest forms. This is also where we must acknowledge and understand the limitations of our knowledge and the tools we use to gain it.

The *scientific method*, with its cycle of observation, hypothesis, experimentation, and revision, is a powerful engine for generating knowledge. It’s a formalized system of asking yes-no questions and interpreting the universe’s answers. However, science operates under the principle of *falsifiability*—the idea that a theory is only scientific if it can, in principle, be proven false. This means that scientific knowledge is always provisional, always subject to revision as new information emerges.

Consider a naive weather forecaster who simply predicts that tomorrow’s weather will be the same as today’s. Remarkably, this simple method is accurate about 50% of the time. This baseline accuracy provides valuable information, demonstrating that there are underlying patterns and persistence in weather systems, even if they are complex and chaotic.

Meteorologists, of course, go far beyond this naive approach. They build sophisticated *models* that incorporate vast amounts of data—temperature, pressure, wind patterns, humidity, and more—to create probabilistic forecasts of future weather. These models are essentially complex algorithms that process information about the past and present to generate a range of possible future scenarios. They are constantly being updated and refined as new information becomes available, increasing their accuracy. Similarly, my experience in travel forecasting involved building models that analyzed historical travel patterns, economic indicators, seasonal trends, and even seemingly random events like pandemics, to predict future travel demand. These models, like those used in meteorology, are not perfect, but they are valuable tools that allow us to make informed decisions based on probabilities.

These models are simply formalized systems for asking questions about available information. Weather models ask questions like: “If the wind is blowing in this direction at this speed, and the temperature is this, and the humidity is that, what is the probability of rain tomorrow?” They then combine millions of these small questions together to create larger forecasts. Similarly, travel forecasting models ask questions like, “If gas prices are this high, and consumer confidence is this low, and there’s a holiday next month, how likely are people to travel?” Each individual question might seem simple, but in aggregation, they create a complex understanding. The accuracy of these models depends on both the quality of questions asked, and the quality and breadth of the data used to answer those questions.

> The very act of creating and using these models is a testament to the power of information and the inherent predictability, to a certain extent, of the universe. But it’s crucial to remember that these are *models*, not mirrors of reality. **They are like *maps* of a territory, and as the saying goes, “the map is not the territory.“**

**Here, the analogy of a map becomes particularly illuminating.** Our blueprints, the underlying informational structure of our potential, can be likened to the physical *territory*—the spacetime we inhabit. It’s the reality “out there,” the complex and dynamic landscape of the universe. The informational universe, the realm of “it from bit,” is the set of all possible maps, the underlying data from which any representation can be derived.

Our *models*, our scientific theories, our mental constructs, and even our individual understandings of our blueprints, are like *maps* of that territory. A good map, like a good model, is a simplified representation that captures the essential features of the territory, allowing us to navigate it effectively. A roadmap, for instance, doesn’t show every tree, every blade of grass, or every building. It abstracts the relevant information—roads, towns, landmarks—to help us get from one point to another. Similarly, a weather forecast doesn’t predict the trajectory of every molecule of air, but it captures the overall patterns to give us a probabilistic sense of future conditions. These maps can even be specialized, like *projections* used in cartography to depict the 3D Earth on a 2D surface, each with its own strengths and distortions. Or a topographical map that depicts elevation changes.

> **But just as a map can never be a perfect replica of the territory, our models can never fully capture the infinite complexity of the universe.**

They are inherently incomplete, subject to limitations and biases. Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems reinforce this notion, demonstrating that even in the realm of pure logic, there will always be truths that lie beyond the reach of any formal system.

Furthermore, just as a map becomes useless if it’s as detailed as the territory itself, a model that tries to incorporate every single variable would be too complex to be useful. *Simplification* is essential for understanding. We must choose which aspects of reality to represent and which to omit, based on our specific needs and goals. And perhaps most importantly, sometimes we simply do not have access to the information that we need in order to render our models useful.

The “block universe” concept, often associated with Einstein’s theories, is a prime example of a simplified model. While useful for visualizing spacetime, it presents a static, predetermined view that doesn’t fully align with the dynamic, probabilistic nature of reality illuminated by quantum mechanics and the “it from bit” perspective. It’s like a map that shows the roads but not the traffic, the terrain but not the weather. Similarly, our human tendency towards *anthropocentrism*—placing ourselves at the center of the universe—can distort our understanding. We project our own limited perspectives onto the cosmos, forgetting that we are but one small part of a vast and ancient universe, likely teeming with other forms of life and intelligence. Astrology, for example, can be seen as a vestige of this anthropocentric bias, assuming that the positions of celestial bodies have a direct and specific influence on human affairs, as viewed from our very limited and human-centric perspective.

> What does this have to do with our individual blueprints and the informational universe? Just as meteorologists and travel forecasters build models to predict weather and travel demand, we, too, build internal models of reality based on our experiences, our knowledge, and the information we receive. These internal models are the foundation of our decision-making processes.

Our brains are essentially prediction machines. Every action we take is based on an implicit forecast about the likely outcome. When you reach for a glass of water, you are predicting that your hand will move in the right direction, that the glass will be there, and that the water will quench your thirst. These predictions are based on neural pathways that have been formed and strengthened through past experiences—a process known as *reinforcement learning*.

Each time a prediction is confirmed, the corresponding neural pathway is strengthened, making that prediction more likely to be made again in the future. Conversely, when a prediction is incorrect, the pathway is weakened. This is analogous to how machine learning algorithms learn from data, constantly updating their internal models based on feedback. Our brains do the same, constantly updating our understanding of the world based on the information we receive. The human brain is essentially a biological algorithm, constantly learning, refining its predictive models, and strengthening the neural pathways associated with accurate predictions. This is how we navigate the world, anticipate consequences, and strive to align our actions with our desired outcomes.

This process of building and refining internal models is directly related to the yes-no questions we pose to the universe. Each question we ask, each action we take, provides feedback that either reinforces or challenges our existing models. When our models are accurate, when our questions align with the underlying structure of the informational universe, we experience success, fulfillment, and a sense of being “on the right path.” When our models are inaccurate, we experience setbacks, challenges, and the feeling of being “lost.”

**Herein lies the significance of our “age of reason.”** We are not born with fully formed, accurate models of reality. Our initial blueprints are rudimentary, shaped by instinct and basic needs. In our early years, we operate largely on autopilot, driven by impulses and immediate gratification. We are, in a sense, *ignorant* of the larger informational landscape. We haven’t yet developed the capacity for complex reasoning, for asking sophisticated questions, or for understanding the long-term consequences of our actions.

But as we mature, as we accumulate experiences and gather information, our internal models become more sophisticated. We begin to develop a sense of self, separate from our surroundings. We learn to delay gratification, to consider the potential outcomes of our choices, and to make decisions based on reason rather than impulse. This is the transition to the “age of reason” – the point where we become more conscious participants in the unfolding of our blueprints, where we start to truly *interrogate* the universe rather than simply react to it.

This transition marks a crucial turning point. We move from a state of relative ignorance, where our actions are largely driven by instinct and immediate feedback, to a state of increasing knowledge, where our actions are guided by more comprehensive models of reality. We begin to understand that our internal maps, while useful, are not perfect representations of the territory. We learn to tolerate ambiguity, to embrace uncertainty, and to constantly update our maps based on new information.

Higher levels of consciousness, then, might be understood as states of greater informational integration—the ability to perceive and process a wider range of information, to recognize more subtle patterns, to build more accurate and comprehensive models of reality, and to ask more profound questions. It is about expanding our awareness beyond the immediate and the obvious, to encompass the interconnectedness of all things within the informational universe, including the branching possibilities that constitute the future. As we learn and grow, our questions to the universe naturally evolve.

> Early questions like, “**What do I want to be when I grow up?**,” might evolve into more profound inquiries like, “**What is my purpose?**” and “**How can I best serve the greater good?**” These questions, posed with sincerity and openness, can lead to profound shifts in our understanding of ourselves and our place in the universe.

The questions we ask, in essence, determine the threads we add to the tapestry and the overall design that emerges. This means that cultivating a mindset of continuous learning, curiosity, and self-reflection is not just beneficial—it is essential to fulfilling our potential. It’s about constantly updating our internal models of reality based on the feedback we receive, refining our questions, and becoming more adept at navigating the complexities of the informational universe.

**And this is where the organic, self-driven nature of knowledge acquisition comes into play.** We don’t simply accumulate information in a linear, predetermined fashion. Instead, we follow the threads of our curiosity, much like navigating a vast, interconnected encyclopedia like Wikipedia.

>  **Consider the experience of browsing Wikipedia.** You might start with a specific question, a particular entry you want to read. But then, as you read, you encounter hyperlinks—connections to other entries, related concepts, further details. You click on one of these links, and suddenly you’re on a new page, exploring a topic you hadn’t even considered before. This new page, in turn, offers its own set of links, leading you further down the rabbit hole of knowledge.

This process mirrors the way we learn and grow within the informational universe. Each question we ask, each piece of information we encounter, is like a hyperlink, connecting us to a vast network of related concepts and possibilities. As we follow these links, guided by our interests and the feedback we receive, we expand our understanding, refine our models, and discover new avenues for exploration. The universe, in this sense, is like a self-organizing, ever-expanding encyclopedia, constantly providing us with new information, new connections, and new opportunities for growth.

We need not worry about following a prescribed path, or adhering to someone else’s idea of what we should learn or become. The universe, through its inherent interconnectedness, provides the necessary guidance. As we follow our curiosity, as we delve deeper into the subjects that resonate with us, we naturally gravitate towards the information that is most relevant to our individual blueprints, the information that helps us build the best possible structure within the framework of our potential. We become, in a sense, *knowledge machines*, driven by an intrinsic desire to understand, to connect, and to create.

This organic process of knowledge acquisition is not random, but self-organizing. It’s guided by the underlying structure of the informational universe, by the inherent relationships between different concepts, and by the feedback we receive as we explore. It’s a dance between our own curiosity and the universe’s inherent order, a continuous process of questioning, exploration, and discovery. The universe feeds us what we need to know *based on what we’ve already learned*, creating a virtuous cycle of growth and understanding. As long as we remain open to new information, willing to challenge our assumptions, and committed to following the threads of our curiosity, we can trust that the universe will continue to guide us, providing us with the knowledge and experiences we need to fulfill our potential and weave a meaningful tapestry.

There is no ultimate guarantee of a specific future, except perhaps for entropy, but there is the certainty of *becoming*. Each moment is an opportunity to weave a new thread, to contribute to the ever-evolving tapestry of existence. And as we become more skilled at interrogating the universe, more attuned to its subtle responses, we become more conscious co-creators of our own destinies and of the future we share. The beauty of the tapestry lies not just in its completed sections, but in the ongoing process of its creation, in the infinite possibilities that emerge with each new thread, each branching path. Our task, then, is not to predict the future with absolute certainty, but to participate in its conscious creation, guided by the wisdom of the past, the awareness of the present, and an unwavering commitment to weaving a future worthy of the extraordinary potential encoded within each of our unique blueprints. The future is not simply what will happen to us but what we choose to *weave* in concert with the universe, an ongoing act of creation that demands our full attention, intention, and participation, acknowledging that we are not merely building within a predetermined blueprint but co-creating within a dynamic and ever-branching multiverse of possibilities.
