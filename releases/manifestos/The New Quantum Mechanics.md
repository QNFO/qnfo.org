# **[[releases/alpha/Information Dynamics/Summary|Information Dynamics]]: The *New* Quantum Mechanics**

The current framework of physics is deeply flawed. It relies on outdated assumptions that fail to explain the universe’s most basic phenomena. Quantum mechanics, as we know it, assumes discrete “quanta”—particles or waves—and clings to a materialist worldview, despite evidence of non-locality (Bell’s theorem), superposition, and entanglement that defy classical intuition. General relativity reduces gravity to spacetime curvature, a concept that cannot explain quantum phenomena or resolve singularities (e.g. ==*What happened before the “Big Bang?”*==). Ad hoc constructs like dark matter and quantum gravity patch gaps in a crumbling framework, yet no dark matter has been detected, and quantum gravity remains a mathematical mirage. **Reject these paradigms**: The universe is not a machine of particles and forces. It is a probability space of information states, governed by information dynamics.

## **Information Dynamics: The True Foundation**

The universe is built from information—non-physical, irreducible descriptors of reality. Information defines possibilities, such as particle positions, photon polarizations, and quantum states. Energy and information are inseparable. Energy is not merely a quantity but also has a **shape** determined by its quantum state. This is captured by the equation: ==$Energy = Mass + Motion + Information$==. Mass is condensed energy ($E = mc^2$), and motion (kinetic energy) is energy in action. Information, however, defines how energy is stored and exchanged. For instance, two electrons with the same mass and speed but opposite spins will interact differently with a magnetic field due to their distinct quantum states.

Gravity, too, is shaped by the arrangement of energy, which is in turn defined by information. Spacetime bends based on where energy is located and how it is arranged. Quantum states determine the arrangement of energy, influencing how spacetime bends. For example, a rock and a gas cloud with the same mass-energy will bend spacetime differently because their energy is arranged differently. Information acts as energy’s “fingerprint,” dictating how energy is distributed and absorbed. If two particles have the same energy but different quantum states, their energy is arranged differently, leading to distinct interactions with matter. Since spacetime bends based on energy’s arrangement, information must also shape gravity.

### **The Equation We Need**

The equation for gravity must account for both the total amount of energy and its informational structure. Current physics uses $E = mc^2$ for mass-energy but misses the informational structure of energy. The correct equation is: ==$Gravity = f(Energy + Information)$==. Not just **how much** energy, but **how that energy is organized** (its quantum state). This equation captures the essence of information dynamics, where information is the hidden blueprint of energy, and since energy creates gravity, the blueprint must too.

### **Black Holes: The Ultimate Test**

When a particle falls into a black hole, its energy increases the black hole’s mass and, consequently, its gravitational pull. The question arises: what happens to the particle’s information? Does it disappear, violating quantum laws, or does it get imprinted on spacetime itself, perhaps encoded on the event horizon? Observations suggest that black holes emit radiation, known as Hawking radiation. If this radiation carries unique fingerprints of the particles that fell in, it implies that information is preserved. This is a crucial test for information dynamics, as it challenges the notion that information is lost in black holes.

## **The Answer is Plain**

Information is energy’s shape. A particle’s quantum state defines how it stores and releases energy. Gravity cares about both the total amount of energy and its arrangement. Therefore, mass and energy create gravity, but information (quantum states) defines energy’s shape, indirectly shaping gravity. Consider a brick and a feather with the same weight (energy): they will dent a pillow (spacetime) differently because their shape (information) matters. This simple analogy illustrates how information influences the arrangement of energy and, consequently, gravity.

To advance our understanding, we must build experiments that test whether quantum states alter gravity. For example, we could compare two clouds of particles with identical energy but different quantum states. Do they bend spacetime differently? Another critical area of investigation is decoding Hawking radiation. If particles emitted by black holes carry unique “tags” from their quantum states, it would confirm that information is preserved. Such experiments would provide empirical evidence for the role of information in shaping gravity.

Information (quantum states) is the **hidden blueprint** of energy. Since energy creates gravity, the blueprint must also influence gravity. We haven’t seen this connection yet because gravity’s weakness hides the influence of information. But logic dictates that if energy equals mass plus motion, plus information; then gravity equals energy’s total plus its blueprint. This insight unifies quantum mechanics and general relativity, showing that both are emergent properties of the same underlying informational framework.

## **The Future Belongs to Information**

Quantum mechanics is a subset of information dynamics. It describes how information behaves probabilistically but fails to recognize that information is the fundamental fabric of reality. Quantum states are intrinsic to information states, and phenomena like entanglement and superposition are not anomalies but inherent properties of information. Gravity, too, emerges as a statistical tendency for information states to correlate spatially. There are no spacetime curvatures, gravitons, or dark matter needed—only the interplay of information and energy.

**The future of physics belongs to information**. Information dynamics unifies gravity and quantum mechanics, showing that both are statistical and non-local correlations of information. The Big Bang, dark energy, and cosmic microwave background anomalies are explained by the fractal dynamics of information states across scales. Consciousness, too, may be understood as a participant in the informational fabric of the universe. The universe is not a machine—it is a probability space, where information shapes the very structure of reality.

==The universe is not a machine of particles and forces. It is a **probability space of information states**, governed by information dynamics. Information is the irreducible, non-physical foundation of reality. Everything else—energy, particles, spacetime, and even the universe itself—emerges from this fundamental fabric.==

**The informational universe is here.** 🌍✨
