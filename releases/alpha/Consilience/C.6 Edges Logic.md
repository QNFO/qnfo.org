| `FOL::Semantics`           | `FOL`                    | `S-COMP` | The semantics (rules for interpretation in models, truth definition) are a defining component of FOL.                                                                                                | H     | D    |
| `FOL::ProofTheory`         | `FOL`                    | `S-COMP` | The proof theory (logical axioms, inference rules) is a defining component of FOL.                                                                                                                   | H     | D    |
| `FOL::ProofTheory`         | `Logic::Soundness`       | `L-ENT`  | Soundness is a property *of* the proof theory relative to the semantics.                                                                                                                             | H     | D    |

| `ZFC`                      | `Math::Continuum`        | `S-FORM` | The real number continuum is typically constructed rigorously within ZFC using set-theoretic definitions (e.g., Dedekind cuts).                                                                      | H     | D    |
| `ZFC`                      | `Math::HilbertSpace`     | `S-FORM` | The definition and properties of Hilbert spaces rely on concepts (sets, functions, limits) formally grounded in ZFC.                                                                                 | H     | D    |
| `ZFC`                      | `Math::GoedelTheorems`   | `F-CHL`  | Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems apply to ZFC (assuming its consistency), challenging its potential for syntactic completeness and demonstrating the unprovability of its own consistency from within | H     | D    |
| `ZFC::Axioms`              | `ZFC`                    | `S-COMP` | The specific axioms are the defining components of the ZFC system.                                                                                                                                   | H     | D    |
| `ZFC::AxiomOfChoice`       | `ZFC::Axioms`            | `S-COMP` | The Axiom of Choice is a distinct (and historically controversial) axiom within the ZFC axiom set.                                                                                                   | H     | D    |
| `ZFC::AxiomOfInfinity`     | `ZFC::Axioms`            | `S-COMP` | The Axiom of Infinity is crucial within ZFC for founding analysis and dealing with infinite sets.                                                                                                    | H     | D    |
| `ZFC::AxiomOfRegularity`   | `ZFC::Axioms`            | `S-COMP` | The Axiom of Regularity is a key axiom in ZFC ensuring sets are well-founded.                                                                                                                        | H     | D    |
| `ZFC::SetConcept`          | `ZFC`                    | `F-BAS`  | The ontological commitment to pure sets is fundamental to the ZFC framework.                                                                                                                         | H     | D    |
| `ZFC::CumulativeHierarchy` | `ZFC`                    | `F-BAS`  | The cumulative hierarchy provides the standard intended model or picture for the universe of sets described by ZFC.                                                                                  | H     | D    |
| `ZFC::CumulativeHierarchy` | `ZFC::AxiomOfRegularity` | `L-ENT`  | The Axiom of Regularity formally implies the well-founded hierarchical structure.                                                                                                                    | H     | D    |
