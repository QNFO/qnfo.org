**Appendix A: Detailed Graph Data (Nodes)**

This appendix provides the definitive and exhaustive data defining the nodes (fundamental entities, components, concepts) constituting the conceptual network graph analyzed in this work (Sections 5, 6, 7). This data serves as the traceable foundation for the structural analysis, critiques, and synthesis presented.
