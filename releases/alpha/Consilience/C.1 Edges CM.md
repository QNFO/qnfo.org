| `QM::IntrinsicIndeterminism`| `Phil::CausalClosure`       | `F-CHL`| If quantum events are truly random, it potentially challenges the idea that all physical events have sufficient *physical* causes.       | M     | D    |

| `QM::Entanglement`          | `CM::Locality`              | `F-CHL`| Entanglement demonstrates non-local correlations that challenge the implicit locality assumptions of classical mechanics.                 | H     | D    |
| `QM::Entanglement`          | `Phil::LocalRealism`        | `L-CTR`| Experimental verification of Bell’s theorem violations using entangled states contradicts local realism.                                | H     | S    |
