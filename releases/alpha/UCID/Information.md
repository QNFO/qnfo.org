# Core Variables

UCID operationalizes human-scale information dynamics through **six core variables**, adapted from the principles of Information Dynamics (ID). These variables bridge cosmic-scale phenomena (e.g., gravity, time) with human experiences (e.g., legacy, ethics). Below is a detailed breakdown:  

## **1. Existence (X)**

**Definition**:  
A binary condition indicating whether information **impacts legacy or decisions**.  
\[  
X_{\text{user}} = \begin{cases}  
1 & \text{if the information is meaningful and legacy-defining}, \\  
0 & \text{otherwise}.  
\end{cases}  
\]  
**Cosmic Analogy**:  
In ID, galaxies exist (\(X=1\)) because their gravitational clumping (\(\rho_{\text{info}} \cdot \kappa \geq 1\)) exceeds thresholds.  
**Human Context**:  
- A career pivot (\(X=1\)) shapes your legacy.  
- A fleeting thought (\(X=0\)) does not.  
**Example**:  
A scientist’s published paper (\(X=1\)) contributes to their legacy, while a discarded coffee stain (\(X=0\)) does not.  

## **2. Information (\(\mathbf{I}\))**

**Definition**:  
A vector encoding measurable properties of your life.  

UCID organizes information into four nested layers, each with distinct mathematical properties:  

1. **Universal Information ($\mathbf{I}$)**: The irreducible substrate of all knowledge, analogous to a statistical population. While $\mathbf{I}$ cannot be directly observed, it encompasses all possible states (e.g., thoughts, skills, decisions).  

2. **Constructed Axes ($\hat{\mathbf{I}}^\alpha$)**: Abstract models derived from $\mathbf{I}$ to interpret specific domains. Examples include career goals ($\hat{\mathbf{I}}^{\text{career}}$) or emotional states ($\hat{\mathbf{I}}^{\text{emotion}}$). These constructs function like coordinate systems in physics but are scoped to human contexts.  

3. **Measurable Axes ($\mathbf{i}^\beta$)**: Numeric or categorical dimensions quantifying $\hat{\mathbf{I}}^\alpha$. For instance, job applications ($\mathbf{i}^{\text{applied\_job}}$) or mood scores ($\mathbf{i}^{\text{mood\_score}}$).  

4. **Observations ($\hat{\mathbf{i}}^\beta_j$)**: Recorded values along measurable axes (e.g., $\hat{\mathbf{i}}^{\text{mood\_score}}_{t=2023-11-01} = 7$).  

---

## **3. Contrast (\(\kappa\))**

**Definition**:  
Measures **meaningful differences** in priorities or states.  
\[  
\kappa_{\text{user}} = \frac{\text{Difference in Goals}}{\epsilon_{\text{user}}}.  
\]  
**Cosmic Analogy**:  
Galaxies form when \(\kappa_{\text{gravity}} = \frac{\text{Distance Between States}}{\epsilon_{\text{cosmic}}} \geq 1\).  
**Human Context**:  
- A career shift (\(\kappa_{\text{user}} \geq 1\)) contrasts sharply with trivial actions.  
- \(\epsilon_{\text{user}}\) adjusts how granularly you perceive differences (e.g., encrypting emotions vs. sharing raw data).  
**Example**:  
A teacher’s pivot from traditional to project-based learning yields \(\kappa_{\text{user}} = 1.2\), marking a meaningful change.  

---

## **4. Sequence (\(\tau\))**

**Definition**:  
An **ordered progression of decisions or experiences**, forming your legacy.  
\[  
\tau_{\text{user}} = \left( \mathbf{I}_1, \mathbf{I}*2, \dots \right).  
\]  
**Cosmic Analogy**:  
The cosmic \(\tau*{\text{cosmic}}\) tracks galaxy formation over time.  
**Human Context**:  
- A decade of job applications (\(\tau_{\text{user}}\)) reveals patterns (e.g., consistent ethical choices).  
- Preserved as an **edge network**, \(\tau_{\text{user}}\) outlives platforms.  
**Example**:  
A climate activist’s \(\tau_{\text{user}}\) (protests → policy advocacy → founding a nonprofit) becomes a knowledge clump for future generations.  

---

## **5. Resolution (\(\epsilon\))**

**Definition**:  
Controls **data granularity**, balancing privacy and utility.  
\[  
\epsilon_{\text{user}} \in [0, 1] \quad \text{(0 = raw data, 1 = anonymized trends)}.  
\]  
**Cosmic Analogy**:  
Planck-scale \(\epsilon_{\text{Planck}}\) defines what is physically perceivable.  
**Human Context**:  
- **High \(\epsilon\)**: Anonymized summaries (e.g., “My carbon footprint decreased by 20%”).  
- **Low \(\epsilon\)**: Raw data (e.g., encrypted voice recordings).  
- **Privacy Tool**: Federated learning ensures sensitive \(\mathbf{I}\) remains on-device.  
**Example**:  
A doctor might set \(\epsilon_{\text{user}} = 0.3\) to share anonymized patient trends while encrypting personal notes.  

---

## **6. Repetition (\(\rho\))**

**Definition**:  
Quantifies **consistency in actions**, rewarding habits over one-offs.  
\[  
\rho_{\text{user}} = \frac{\text{Number of repeated actions}}{\text{Total actions}}.  
\]  
**Cosmic Analogy**:  
Star formation cycles (\(\rho_{\text{cosmic}}\)) drive galaxy evolution.  
**Human Context**:  
- A developer who codes daily has \(\rho_{\text{code}} = 0.9\).  
- \(\rho\) identifies growth patterns (e.g., “I meditate 80% of days”).  
**Example**:  
A farmer’s consistent use of sustainable practices (\(\rho_{\text{sustainable}} = 0.8\)) builds trust in their legacy.  

---

## **7. Mimicry (\(M\))**

**Definition**:  
Alignment of **decisions with ethical or creative goals**, derived from \(\tau_{\text{user}}\) analysis.  
\[  
M_{\text{user}} = \frac{\text{Similarity between choices and goals}}{\kappa_{\text{max}}}.  
\]  
**Cosmic Analogy**:  
Quantum mimicry (entanglement) in ID.  
**Human Context**:  
- High \(M\) (e.g., \(M_{\text{AI ethics}} = 0.9\)) means actions closely mirror values.  
- Tools like Pebble analyze \(\tau_{\text{user}}\) to flag misalignment.  
**Example**:  
An AI developer’s code mimicking sustainability guidelines (\(M_{\text{user}} = 0.85\)) signals ethical alignment.  

---

## **Interactions In the Strange Loop**

These variables form a **reciprocal system**:  
1. **Micro → Macro**:  
   - Your \(\tau_{\text{user}}\) (e.g., career shifts) aggregates into societal \(\rho_{\text{info}} \cdot \kappa\) (e.g., industry trends).  
2. **Macro → Micro**:  
   - Societal patterns (e.g., climate policies) reshape your \(\tau_{\text{user}}\), closing the loop.  

---

## **Why These Variables Matter**

| **Variable** | **Purpose** | **Human Impact** |  
|--------------|-------------|------------------|  
| \(X\)         | Filters what matters | Ensures legacies exclude noise |  
| \(\mathbf{I}\) | Captures your life’s data | Enables edge networks for preservation |  
| \(\kappa\)     | Identifies meaningful shifts | Prioritizes growth over inertia |  
| \(\tau\)       | Tracks decision histories | Reveals causal patterns (e.g., “My anxiety caused this career delay”) |  
| \(\epsilon\)   | Balances privacy and utility | Protects sovereignty while enabling societal clumping |  
| \(\rho\)       | Measures habit consistency | Drives ethical or creative momentum |  
| \(M\)          | Aligns actions with values | Ensures AI and choices reflect your ethics |  

---

## **Example: The Climate Activist’s Journey**

1. **\(X_{\text{user}} = 1\)**: Their career pivot to sustainability is legacy-defining.  
2. **\(\mathbf{I}_{\text{user}}\)**: Includes protest notes, policy drafts, and mood data.  
3. **\(\kappa_{\text{user}} = 1.5\)**: Their shift from activism to policy work is significant.  
4. **\(\tau_{\text{user}}\)**: Tracks their decade-long journey from student to advocate.  
5. **\(\epsilon_{\text{user}} = 0.6\)**: Shares anonymized trends while encrypting raw notes.  
6. **\(\rho_{\text{user}} = 0.8\)**: Consistently prioritizes ethical choices.  
7. **\(M_{\text{user}} = 0.9\)**: Their actions mimic sustainability goals.  

**Result**:  
- **Legacy**: Their \(\tau_{\text{user}}\) becomes a global edge network.  
- **Feedback Loop**: Their work aggregates into societal \(\rho_{\text{info}} \cdot \kappa\), reshaping policies that then inspire new \(\tau_{\text{user}}\).  

---

## **Key Takeaways**

- **User-Centric Design**: Variables like \(\epsilon\) and \(X\) put control in your hands.  
- **Legacy as a Sequence**: \(\tau_{\text{user}}\) turns scattered data into a narrative.  
- **Ethics and Growth**: \(M\), \(\rho\), and \(\kappa\) quantify alignment with values.  

These variables collectively enable UCID’s framework to model how **your choices ripple into societal patterns** and vice versa—without overreaching into physics. The next step is to formalize their mathematical relationships, starting with the **Human Potential Equation**:  
\[  
\text{Human Potential} = \frac{M_{\text{user}} \cdot \lambda_{\text{user}} \cdot \rho_{\text{user}}}{\epsilon_{\text{user}}}.  
\]  
This equation guides developers to build systems that empower individuals to **live their best lives and leave legacies worth preserving**.
