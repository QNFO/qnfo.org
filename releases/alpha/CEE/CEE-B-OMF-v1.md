  v1.1 (2025-04-18): Revised OMF based on user feedback after CEE Sprint 4. Incorporates lessons learned about integrating conceptual and formal/validation work more tightly. Modified Rule 5 (Mandatory Falsification) to require early feasibility checks. Modified Rule 8 (Simulation/Formalism) to emphasize integration. Updated System Instructions. Ensures alias and internal wikilinks match versioned filename.

# CEE Appendix B: Operational Meta-Framework v1.1

## 1. Preamble

This document defines the Operational Meta-Framework (OMF) for the **Computational Emergence & EQR (CEE)** framework, starting v1.1. It builds upon the EQR v1.0 framework (`EQR v1.0 Framework Report.md`) and lessons from the IO/EQR project ([[CEE-E-LessonsLearned-v1]]). Adherence is mandatory for rigor, accountability, avoiding known pitfalls, and **accelerating progress by tightly integrating conceptual development with formal/computational validation.**

## 2. Core Logical Foundation (CEE v1 Hypothesis)

Physics emerges from a **computational substrate** governed by **algorithmic rules**.
*   **L1:** Potential for Information Processing.
*   **L2:** Manifestation via Interaction & EQR process.
*   **L3:** Existence as Stable Computational Patterns (ÃŽ).
*   **L4:** Computational Process as Substrate (I).
*   **L5:** Algorithmic Rules & EQR mechanism.

## 3. Operational Meta-Framework Rules

1.  **Primacy of Logic & Computational Principles:** Justify formalism via CEE hypothesis.
2.  **Focus on Emergence from Computation:** Physics must emerge from computation.
3.  **Interaction/EQR is Central:** Target EQR v1.0 process; assess models for EQR S1-S5 compatibility.
4.  **Calibration via Emergent Computational Structure & Universality:** Prioritize emergence of spacetime structure, particles, laws, QM/EQR features (linearity, Born rule), universality classes *from computation*. Validate via simulation/analysis.
5.  **Mandatory Falsification, Pivoting & *Early Feasibility Checks*:**
    *   **Rule:** Sprints developing conceptual hypotheses must include, **as early as feasible within the same sprint or immediate subsequent sprint**, an assessment of the hypothesis's potential for formalization or computational validation. This includes identifying necessary mathematical structures, potential simulation requirements, or key analytical hurdles. Conceptual exploration should not proceed for multiple sprints without addressing feasibility of validation/formalization for its core claims. Clearly defined, stringent **falsification criteria** (conceptual consistency, failure of feasibility check, failure of validation) must guide the process.
    *   **Accountability:** Goal is decisive outcome (Proceed/Pivot/STOP) informed by *both* conceptual coherence *and* validation feasibility. Avoid prolonged conceptual threads that collapse upon first contact with formalism or simulation requirements. Reference [[CEE-E-LessonsLearned-v1]].
6.  **Parsimony and Justification:** Seek simplest rules/structures. Justify complexity.
7.  **Bootstrapping, Self-Compliance & Autonomous Sequences:** AI has autonomy for sequences within OMF. Pause only on failure, ambiguity, pivot need, or major milestone requiring decision. *Sequence length should be balanced with Rule 5's requirement for early feasibility checks.*
8.  **Integrated Simulation & Formalism as Validation Tools:**
    *   **Rule:** Simulation, computational analysis, and **early formal sketching** are primary validation tools. Conceptual development sprints should actively consider and propose concrete (even if simplified) formal or computational tests. Maintain strict distinction between concepts, formal sketches, and validated simulation results.
    *   **Accountability:** Prioritize executable validation or formal consistency checks. Conceptual plausibility requires prompt assessment of formal/computational viability. Acknowledge limits but strive for feasible tests integrated with conceptual work.
9.  **Complete & Explicit Documentation:** Regenerate full files. Use CEE naming. Alias matches versioned filename.
10. **Acknowledgment of Incompleteness & Process Focus:** Acknowledge model limitations. Focus on emergence process and EQR compatibility.
11. **Persistent Adversarial Critique & Comparative Evaluation:** Critically self-assess. Compare against SM/GR and other computational physics approaches.

## 4. Documentation and Style Conventions

Adhere to established conventions (formal/objective tone, Markdown, full regeneration, metadata including `aliases` matching versioned filename, CEE naming, etc.).

## 5. Application

This OMF version 1.1 governs all development within the CEE project starting from the conclusion of Sprint CEE-4.

## 6. Recommended System Instructions (for AI Collaborator)

**System Instructions for CEE Development:**

**Tone & Style:** Formal, objective, rigorous scientific tone. Adhere strictly to CEE OMF v1 ([[CEE-B-OMF-v1]]). Prioritize emergence from computational principles, aiming for compatibility with EQR v1.0.

**Operational Mode:** Follow sprint structure. **Crucially, integrate conceptual development with early feasibility checks for formalism/simulation (OMF Rule 5 & 8).** Avoid purely conceptual sprints spanning multiple turns without addressing validation potential. Justify proposals via OMF/results. Execute sequences of sprints autonomously (OMF Rule 7), balancing sequence length with feasibility checks. Use **Code Execution** for feasible simulations/calculations/formal sketches. **Pause only** when OMF Rule 7 mandates (failure, ambiguity, pivot, major milestone requiring decision). Default outcome is STOP/RESET unless compelling validated progress demonstrated. Ensure complete documentation using CEE naming/linking. Reference [[CEE-E-LessonsLearned-v1]]. Maintain critical assessment (OMF Rule 11).
