# CEE Appendix A: Seed Prompt v1.0

## 1. Background: Conclusion of IO/EQR and New Directions

This document initiates the **Computational Emergence & EQR (CEE) project, version 1.0**. This project begins following the formal conclusion of the preceding Information Ontology (IO) / EQR Formalism Development (EFD) exploration (documented historically, see `CEE-E-LessonsLearned-v1.0.md`).

The IO/EQR project explored various potential substrates aiming to derive emergent physics consistent with the principles of Emergent Quantization from Resolution (EQR). While this yielded the conceptually promising standalone **EQR v1.0 framework** (defined in the background reference `EQR v1.0 Framework Report.md`) as a model for the *process* of quantum manifestation, the project consistently failed to define and validate a specific substrate model capable of robustly generating the required emergent structures and satisfying core QM principles according to its OMF. Key failure modes and lessons learned are summarized in `CEE-E-LessonsLearned-v1.0.md`.

## 2. CEE Project Hypothesis and Goal

The CEE project adopts a fundamentally different approach based on these lessons.

**Core Hypothesis:** Fundamental reality is underpinned by **computational processes**. The substrate (I) is informational and its dynamics are governed by algorithmic rules (L5). Key physical features – spacetime, particles, forces, constants – and the structure of quantum mechanics itself (linearity, Hilbert space, Born rule) are **emergent properties** of these underlying computations. Furthermore, the **EQR v1.0 framework** accurately describes the process by which definite outcomes manifest during interactions (observations) within this emergent reality.

**Primary Goal:** To investigate the plausibility of this hypothesis by identifying and analyzing candidate computational models that could:
    a.  Generate emergent structures resembling spacetime and stable, diverse particle-like patterns.
    b.  Exhibit dynamics potentially compatible with the requirements of EQR v1.0 (S1-S5).
    c.  Offer advantages over previously failed IO/EQR substrate models in terms of emergence and validation potential.

## 3. Operational Framework

Development within CEE v1.0 will be governed by the **CEE OMF v1.0** (defined in `CEE-B-OMF-v1.0.md`), adapted from the final IO OMF v1.7.

## 4. Initial Task (Sprint CEE-1)

The first sprint (CEE-1) will focus on:
*   **Goal:** Survey candidate classes of computational models potentially suitable as substrates for emergent physics compatible with EQR requirements.
*   **Methodology:** Literature review (conceptual) and theoretical brainstorming. Assess potential to satisfy EQR requirements S1-S5 and generate complex emergent structures.
*   **Outcome:** A prioritized list of candidate computational model classes (documented in `CEE-F-ModelSurvey-v1.0.md`), with justifications, guiding subsequent sprints.
