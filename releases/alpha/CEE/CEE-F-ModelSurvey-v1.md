# CEE Appendix F: Candidate Computational Models Survey v1

## 1. Introduction

This document summarizes the initial survey of candidate computational model classes considered at the outset of the Computational Emergence & EQR (CEE) project v1 (Sprint CEE-1). The goal is to identify promising foundational structures capable of generating emergent physical phenomena while also being compatible with the principles of the Emergent Quantization from Resolution (EQR) v1.0 framework (`EQR v1.0 Framework Report.md`), particularly its requirements S1-S5. This assessment is guided by [[CEE-B-OMF-v1]] and [[CEE-E-LessonsLearned-v1]].

## 2. Candidate Model Classes & Assessment

### 2.1. Graph/Network Rewriting Systems (e.g., WPP)

*   **Description:** States = hypergraphs; Dynamics = discrete subgraph replacement rules.
*   **Emergence Potential:** Strong (spacetime, causality, particle-like patterns). Background independent.
*   **EQR Compatibility:** Weak (S1/S4 Hilbert/Linearity/Born rule major challenge; S3 Basis selection unclear). High risk of repeating IO failures without novel QM emergence mechanism.
*   **Assessment:** High priority for structure, but QM/EQR compatibility is critical hurdle.

### 2.2. Quantum Cellular Automata (QCA) / Quantum Walks (QW)

*   **Description:** Quantum states on discrete lattice/graph; Unitary local evolution.
*   **Emergence Potential:** Weak (assumes background lattice). Can support particle-like excitations.
*   **EQR Compatibility:** Strong for S1/S4 (built-in QM). Weak for S3/P5 (EQR process not emergent). Background dependence issue.
*   **Assessment:** Less aligned with full emergence goal.

### 2.3. Causal Set Theory (+ Dynamics)

*   **Description:** Spacetime = discrete partial order; Dynamics = stochastic growth.
*   **Emergence Potential:** Strong (spacetime manifold, Lorentz invariance). Background independent.
*   **EQR Compatibility:** Weak/Unclear (formulating QM/EQR on causal sets is challenging).
*   **Assessment:** Promising for spacetime, but QM/EQR integration needs major development.

### 2.4. Algorithmic / Information-Theoretic Models

*   **Description:** Universe as computation; laws from information/complexity constraints.
*   **Emergence Potential:** Abstract (complexity, statistical mechanics).
*   **EQR Compatibility:** Weak/Abstract (potential links via S5/P4, but S1/S3/S4 connection unclear).
*   **Assessment:** Too abstract currently; lacks clear path to concrete physics/EQR structure.

### 2.5. Generalized Iterative Systems (Beyond IO v4.2)

*   **Description:** Iterative rules $S_{t+1}=F(S_t)$ on potentially different state spaces (networks, functions) aiming to solve linearity/Born rule problem (e.g., via Koopman + envariance).
*   **Emergence Potential:** Dependent on specific model.
*   **EQR Compatibility:** Aims for compatibility by design. S3 (attractors) natural. S1/S4 (linearity/Born rule) remains key challenge requiring innovation (as identified in IO v4.2/EFD).
*   **Assessment:** Direct continuation of a promising but stalled thread. Success hinges on solving the identified formal QM emergence problem.

## 3. Prioritization and Conclusion (from Sprint CEE-1)

*   **Graph Rewriting Systems (GRS)** offer the strongest current potential for *emergent structure*. Priority: Investigate GRS focusing explicitly on integrating/deriving QM/EQR compatibility.
*   **Generalized Iterative Systems (GIS)** offer strongest potential for *EQR compatibility*. Priority: Keep as secondary path, contingent on novel ideas for solving linearity/Born rule problem.

**Recommendation:** Initiate investigation into **Graph Rewriting Systems**, focusing on the QM/EQR interface.
