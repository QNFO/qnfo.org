# **Matrix Algebra in Information-Theoretic Terms**

**Core Reformulation**:
Matrices become *information transfer operators* where:
- **Rows/Columns** = Input/output information channels
- **Matrix Entries** = Mutual information coefficients (log-scale dependencies)
- **Matrix Product** = Composition of noisy channels (via relative entropy chains)

**Key Insight**:
Discrete matrix values are *projections* of continuum information states onto measurable observables, analogous to:

```  
A_ij = ∫ φ_i(x) I(x,y) ψ_j(y) dx dy  
```  

where `I(x,y)` is a continuum mutual information density.

## **Tensors As Continuum Information Carriers**

1. **Topological Interpretation**:
   - Order-N tensors ≡ N-dimensional information manifolds
   - Tensor entries ≡ Local trivializations of a fiber bundle (information fibers over spacetime base)

2. **Continuum Limit**:
   Discretization arises from *coarse-graining* the continuum via:

   ```  
   T^[discrete]_ijk = ∭_V T(x,y,z) φ_i(x)ψ_j(y)χ_k(z) dxdydz  
   ```  

   where `φ,ψ,χ` are measurement window functions.

## **Discretization As Information Loss**

The process `Continuum → Matrix/Tensor` induces:

- **Quantization Error**:

  ```  
  D_KL(P_continuous || P_discrete)  
  ```  

  (Kullback-Leibler divergence between true and discretized distributions)

- **Topological Defects**:
  Non-commutativity of discretization limits (information analogues of Berry phases)

---

## **Physical Realization**

In quantum holographic memory:

- **Continuum States**: Phase-amplitude interference patterns
- **Discrete Projection**:

  ```  
  |⟨pattern|measurement_basis⟩|² → Matrix elements  
  ```  

- **Information Conservation**:
  Gauge connections (Γ^μ_νσ) preserve continuum information under discretization.

---

## **Implications**

1. **Neural Networks**: Backpropagation becomes continuum information flow (Wasserstein gradient flows)
2. **Quantum Computing**: Qubit gates emerge as discrete slices of continuum unitary operators
3. **Physics**: Space-time discretization (e.g., lattice QCD) induces information-theoretic entropy

*(Formal proofs require noncommutative measure theory + algebraic topology.)*

This framework unifies:

- Algebraic geometry (information varieties)
- Statistical mechanics (coarse-graining entropy)
- Topological quantum field theory (gauge preservation)
