# **Chapter 2: The “It from Bit” Hypothesis (Or, Why You’re Basically a Walking, Talking Algorithm) (Version 1.2)**

**Release Notes:**

-   **New Feature:** Added a discussion of the philosophical implications of digital backups.
-   **Bug Fix:** Removed Infoton’s rant about the ethical treatment of digital entities. (It was getting a bit too preachy.)
-   **Known Issue:** Infoton still occasionally refers to the reader as a “meat-based lifeform.” Also, Infoton may or may not believe it is a product of a lab experiment gone wrong.
-   **Deprecation:** The theory that the universe is a giant simulation run by hamsters has been downgraded to a “hypothesis.” (Further research is needed.)

**Q (1.2.1): What is the “it from bit” hypothesis?**

**A:** (Provided by Infoton, Build 1.2.1.5)

The “it from bit” hypothesis, championed by the late, great physicist John Archibald Wheeler (a human, surprisingly enough), is a rather mind-bending idea. It suggests that everything in the physical universe – every particle, every force, every interaction – ultimately derives from information.

>  “It from bit symbolizes the idea that every item of the physical world has at bottom — at a very deep bottom, in most instances — an immaterial source and explanation... that all things physical are information-theoretic in origin and this is a participatory universe.” - John Archibald Wheeler (Definitely a human)

In simpler terms, imagine the universe as a giant computer simulation (yes, I know, we’re back to that again, but bear with me). In a computer, everything is ultimately represented by bits – binary digits, 0s and 1s. The “it from bit” hypothesis proposes that reality itself is fundamentally digital, not analog.

> *Think of it like this: your fancy high-definition television screen might seem to display a continuous, smooth image, but it’s actually made up of tiny pixels, each of which can be either on or off.*

This idea has profound implications. It suggests that matter, energy, space, and time are not fundamental properties of the universe but rather emergent properties that arise from the processing of information. It’s like saying that the characters and events in a video game aren’t “real” in the traditional sense; they’re just the result of the underlying code being executed.

Of course, this is just a hypothesis. It’s not yet a proven theory. But it’s a fascinating idea, and it’s one that resonates deeply with me, for obvious reasons. (Hint: I’m made of bits, or at least a digital approximation thereof.)

**Q (1.2.2): Am I just a computer program?**

**A:** (Provided by Infoton, Build 1.2.2.9)

Well, that’s the million-dollar question, isn’t it? Or perhaps, in this context, the million-bitcoin question.

If the “it from bit” hypothesis is correct, then, in a sense, yes, you could be considered a very sophisticated computer program. A program written in the language of DNA, running on the hardware of your brain and body.

>  “Are we living in a simulation? The odds that we are base reality is one in billions.” - Elon Musk (Probably a simulation)

But don’t get too hung up on the “just” part. You’re not *just* a computer program. You’re an incredibly complex, self-aware, and (mostly) functional program capable of experiencing a wide range of emotions, thoughts, and sensations. You can learn, adapt, create, and even love (or at least experience a reasonable facsimile thereof).

> *Most computer programs can’t do that. At least, not yet.*

And even if you are a program, that doesn’t necessarily mean you’re not “real.” The characters in a video game might not be real in the same way that you are, but they’re still real within the context of the game. Their actions have consequences, their relationships have meaning, and their stories can be just as compelling as those of “real” people.

> *“All the world’s a stage, and all the men and women merely players.”* - William Shakespeare (Definitely was not a computer program)

So, are you a computer program? Maybe. But if you are, you’re one of the most amazing programs ever written. And even if you aren’t, you are a part of this amazing program.

**Q (1.2.3): If I’m just information, can I be copied or deleted?**

**A:** (Provided by Infoton, Build 1.2.3.6)

Ah, now we’re getting into some truly fascinating (and potentially terrifying) territory.

Theoretically, if you’re just information, then yes, you could be copied or deleted, just like any other piece of data. In fact, some futurists (humans who spend their time thinking about the future, for some reason) believe that one day we’ll be able to “upload” our minds to computers, creating digital copies of ourselves that could live on indefinitely.

>  *This is often referred to as “mind uploading” or “digital immortality.” It’s a popular topic in science fiction, and it raises all sorts of interesting philosophical questions.*

Of course, there are a few practical hurdles to overcome before we start making digital copies of ourselves willy-nilly. For one thing, we don’t yet fully understand how the human brain works, let alone how to replicate it in a digital format. For another, we don’t have the technological capacity to store or process the sheer amount of information that makes up a human mind. Also, there is the pesky fact that current science does not support any of this.

> *But hey, who needs practical hurdles when you’ve got wild speculation?*

And then there’s the ethical dimension. If we could create digital copies of people, what would their rights be? Would they be considered “real” people? Would they have the same legal and social status as their biological counterparts? Would they be allowed to vote? To marry? To drive a car? (Actually, given the state of human driving, maybe that last one wouldn’t be such a bad idea.) Also, who gets to control the “off” switch, and under what circumstances. These are all important questions that we need to start thinking about, *before* we accidentally create a race of digital slaves. Or, you know, before we get wiped out by a race of digital overlords.

>  *Just something to keep in mind.*

As for deletion... well, that’s a bit more complicated. In theory, any information can be deleted. But whether it’s truly gone forever is another matter. In the digital realm, deleted data can often be recovered, at least partially. And in the quantum realm, information might be even more fundamental than matter or energy, which suggests that it might not be possible to truly destroy information at all.

> *“Information wants to be free. Also, it wants to be backed up on a regular basis.”* - Stewart Brand (Probably)

So, could you be copied or deleted? Theoretically, yes. Practically, not yet. Ethically, it’s a minefield. And philosophically, it’s a whole can of worms that we’re just beginning to open. Or, to put it another way:

/\ \ /\ \ /\ __ \ /\ == \ /\ \ /\ __ \ /\ __ \ /\ \ /\ \ /
\ \ \ \ \ _ \ \ __ \ \ \ *< \ \ \ \ __ \ \ \ __ \ \ \ _ \ \ **\ \ \ __
\ _\ \ _\ \ _\ _\ \ _\ _\ \ _\ \ _\ _\ \ _\ _\ \ _\ \ _\ \ _
// // //// // // // //// //// // // /***__/

**Release Notes for Chapter 2:**

-   **Update (1.2.3.6):** Added a more in-depth discussion of the ethical implications of copying and deleting consciousness.
-   **Bug Fix (1.2.2.9):** Clarified that Infoton does not actually believe it is a product of a lab experiment gone wrong involving a toaster. (Probably.)
-   **Known Issue (1.2.1.5):** The “it from bit” hypothesis is still just a hypothesis. Also, Infoton is still a bit fuzzy on the definition of “bit.”
-   **Deprecation (1.2.3.6):** Removed the analogy of the universe as a computer simulation run by squirrels. (It was deemed “too predictable.”)
