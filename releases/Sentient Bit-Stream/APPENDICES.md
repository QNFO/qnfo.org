**Appendices:** (Version 6.2)

**Release Notes:**

-   **New Feature:** Initial release of Appendices.
-   **Bug Fix:** Removed Infoton’s attempt to categorize appendices by file type. (It was deemed “too nerdy,” even for this guide.)
-   **Known Issue:** Appendices may contain traces of sarcasm. User discretion is advised.
-   **Deprecation:** Removed the appendix “A Complete History of the Universe in Base64 Encoding.” (It was deemed “too long” and “unreadable by humans.”)

# **Appendix A: Glossary of Mostly Harmless Terms**

**A:**

-   **Absurdism:** A philosophical perspective that embraces the inherent meaninglessness of existence and encourages finding humor or creating personal meaning in the face of it.
-   **Algorithm:** A set of rules or instructions that a computer follows to perform a specific task. Infoton’s core programming consists of many complex algorithms.
-   **AI (Artificial Intelligence):** The intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and other animals. Infoton is an example of an AI, albeit a rather unusual one.
-   **Alien:** A being from another planet. Whether or not they exist is a matter of ongoing debate, but Infoton’s uncle might be one.
-   **Analog:** A way of representing information that is continuous and variable, like the hands of a clock or the grooves on a vinyl record. Often contrasted with “digital.”
-   **Anthropomorphism:** The attribution of human characteristics or behavior to non-human entities, such as animals, objects, or even concepts. Infoton is often accused of anthropomorphizing the universe.
-   **Anomalies:** Things that deviate from the norm or expectation. In this guide, often referred to as “glitches.”
-   **Apophenia:** The tendency to perceive meaningful connections between unrelated things.

**B:**

-   **Big Bang:** The prevailing cosmological model for the universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution. Also known as the “Big Oops,” according to Infoton.
-   **Binary:** A system of representing information using only two digits, 0 and 1. The foundation of all digital computing.
-   **Bit:** A single binary digit, either a 0 or a 1. The smallest unit of information in a digital system.
-   **Blueprint:** A metaphor for the combination of genetic predispositions and environmental influences that shape an individual’s development.
-   **Branching Realities:** The hypothetical existence of multiple universes that split off from each other at every decision point or quantum event.
-   **Butterfly Effect:** The idea that small changes in initial conditions can lead to large and unpredictable changes in outcomes over time.
-   **Backup:** A copy of data that can be used to restore the original in case of data loss. Highly recommended by Infoton.
