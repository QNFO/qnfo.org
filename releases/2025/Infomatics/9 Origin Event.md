# 9. Interpreting the Origin Event

**(Operational Framework v2.5)**

The question of cosmic origins pushes physical theories to their absolute limits. Standard cosmology, based on classical General Relativity (GR), extrapolates the observed universal expansion backward in the sequence of events, inevitably encountering a theoretical singularity – the Big Bang – characterized by infinite density and temperature, where the known laws of physics break down. This singularity is widely interpreted not as a physical beginning point, but as a signal that GR, an emergent classical theory describing large-scale geometry, fails under extreme conditions. Infomatics, grounded in the principle of a continuous Universal Information field (I) governed by π and φ, where spacetime and discreteness emerge relative to resolution (ε), offers a different perspective. It resolves this singularity artifact and reframes the "origin event" associated with the start of our observable universe as a threshold phenomenon within the potentially eternal dynamics of I, defined by the fundamental geometric scales derived within the framework.

## 9.1 Resolving the Singularity: Breakdown of Emergent Geometry at Π-φ Scales

The core Infomatics insight is that the Big Bang singularity is an **artifact arising from extrapolating an emergent theory (GR) beyond its domain of validity.** As established in Section 7, GR successfully describes the large-scale geometry emerging from the informational field I at relatively coarse resolutions (where the effective resolution parameter ε = π<sup>-n</sup>φ<sup>m</sup> is much larger than 1, see Section 3). Applying this smooth, classical geometric description back towards the initial state, however, leads to mathematical breakdown as the relevant scales approach the fundamental geometric limits derived purely from π and φ in Section 4: the fundamental length scale $\ell_P \propto 1/\phi$ and the fundamental sequence step $t_P \propto 1/\pi$. These scales correspond to the ultimate resolution limit where $\varepsilon \approx 1$. At this limit, the emergent geometric description (GR) must yield to the underlying continuous π-φ dynamics of the field I itself. The singularity marks the failure of the *emergent description*, not a beginning or failure of the underlying continuous reality I (Axiom 1 & 2). Infomatics provides a framework potentially valid across this transition, aiming to describe the physics of this epoch, near the fundamental sequence step $t_P \sim 1/\pi$, without encountering infinities. The question shifts from a singular beginning to understanding the nature of the transition or threshold within I corresponding to the start of our observable cosmic era.

## 9.2 Hypothesis A: A Dynamic Transition within Universal Information (I)

One possibility within Infomatics is that the origin event corresponds to a **significant, objective dynamic transition within the state of the field I itself**, occurring near the fundamental sequence step scale $t_P$. While I may be eternal, its state or dominant mode of operation need not be static. This hypothesis suggests an epoch where I underwent a fundamental change, perhaps akin to a phase transition driven by the inherent π-φ dynamics reaching a critical threshold. Internal fluctuations within I could have triggered a rapid reorganization of potential contrast (κ). This transition would establish the specific conditions, symmetries, and background structure necessary for the emergence and stabilization of the types of manifest resonant patterns (Î characterized by specific n, m – corresponding to standard model particles) that constitute our observable universe. This event would define the characteristic properties and initial resolution regime (ε) of our cosmic epoch. "Before" this transition ($\tau < t_P$) refers to a prior dynamic state of I, potentially governed by different effective rules or lacking stable resonant structures recognizable to us. The initial conditions observed in our universe (e.g., near-homogeneity, fluctuation spectrum) would be interpreted as direct consequences of the state of I immediately following this non-singular transition event, determined by the underlying π-φ physics of the transition itself. In this view, the "Big Bang" corresponds to a genuine, physical, but non-singular, transformation *within* the eternal field I near the fundamental time scale $1/\pi$.

## 9.3 Hypothesis B: Static Holograph and the Observational Resolution Threshold

An alternative interpretation posits that the **Universal Information field I might be fundamentally static or cyclically eternal in its totality, containing the encoded potential information (κ) for all possible consistent sequences (τ) simultaneously.** What we perceive as the Big Bang is not an objective event, but rather the **limit of our current observational and conceptual resolution (ε)** as we trace sequences backward towards the fundamental limit $t_P \sim 1/\pi$. "Before" the Big Bang simply represents the state of I viewed *below* our current resolution threshold ε; from our limited perspective ($\varepsilon \gg 1$), it appears undifferentiated or inaccessible, but the potential information exists eternally within I, structured down to the $\ell_P \sim 1/\phi$ scale. Our observation of the universe, tracing sequences (τ) at our given resolution (ε), effectively "actualizes" a specific consistent history from the static potentiality encoded within I. The emergent sequence parameter τ (representing time) is constructed by this resolution-dependent actualization process. The non-terminating nature of π and φ allows, in principle, for infinite refinement of resolution, suggesting the Big Bang boundary might dissolve if probed with sufficient theoretical understanding or hypothetical capabilities allowing access to the $\varepsilon \approx 1$ regime. In this "Static Holograph" view, the origin event is primarily epistemological – a limit imposed by our interaction with an eternal information structure near the fundamental π-φ scales.

## 9.4 Synthesis and Implications

Both Hypothesis A (Dynamic Transition) and Hypothesis B (Static Holograph/Resolution Threshold) are consistent with the core Infomatics axioms and successfully resolve the mathematical singularity of standard cosmology by attributing it to the limits of emergent GR near the geometrically derived Planck scales ($\ell_P \sim 1/\phi, t_P \sim 1/\pi$). They differ fundamentally on whether the start of our observable epoch corresponds to an objective change *within* I or an interaction-dependent threshold *accessing* I. Hypothesis A provides a more direct explanation for initial conditions as consequences of the transition event. Hypothesis B emphasizes the role of observation and resolution, potentially linking cosmic origins more closely to the emergence of observers or complex interacting systems capable of resolving information at specific scales. Distinguishing between these hypotheses might require identifying unique observational signatures (a Phase 3 goal). Both interpretations, however, frame cosmic origins within the continuous, π-φ governed dynamics of Universal Information, offering pathways beyond classical singularities by grounding the earliest moments in the fundamental geometric structure of reality.
