# 8. Cosmological Implications and Resolution of Anomalies

**(Operational Framework v2.1)**

Standard cosmology, encapsulated in the ΛCDM model, successfully describes the large-scale evolution of the universe but achieves this concordance only by invoking two major unknown components – non-baryonic Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and Dark Energy (Λ). Foundational critiques suggest these components may be theoretical artifacts arising from applying potentially flawed theories (General Relativity interpreted classically, standard light propagation assumptions tied to $h$ and $c$) and metrological conventions to interpret cosmological data. Infomatics, grounded in its π-φ geometric principles, emergent gravity (Section 7), and rejection of artifactual constants like $h$, provides a framework aimed at explaining cosmological observations parsimoniously, without invoking these hypothetical dark entities.

## 8.1 Π-φ Gravity and Cosmic Expansion Dynamics

Within Infomatics, spacetime is an emergent structure reflecting the large-scale relational geometry of the Universal Information field I. Its dynamics, manifesting as gravity, are governed by the underlying π-φ principles. The key parameters derived in Section 4, the effective gravitational coupling $G \propto \pi^3/\phi^6$ and the fundamental speed $c = \pi/\phi$, modify the standard Friedmann equations derived from General Relativity. Assuming a spatially flat emergent geometry for simplicity, the first Friedmann equation, describing the expansion rate $H = (1/a)(da/d\tau)$ in terms of sequence parameter τ, takes the approximate form $H^2 \approx \frac{8\pi G_{inf}}{3} \rho_{info}$. Substituting the derived scaling for $G_{inf}$ yields $H^2 \propto \frac{\pi^4}{\phi^6} \rho_{info}$, where $\rho_{info}$ represents the density of manifest information (corresponding to standard matter and radiation energy density). This equation shows that the expansion rate is governed by the informational density scaled by a purely geometric factor derived from π and φ. Initial analysis assuming standard evolution for $\rho_{info}$ (like $\rho_m \propto a^{-3}$ or $\rho_r \propto a^{-4}$) reproduces the standard expansion history ($a \propto \tau^{2/3}$ or $a \propto \tau^{1/2}$) for matter or radiation dominated eras, respectively. This demonstrates basic consistency but highlights that explaining deviations like cosmic acceleration requires exploring mechanisms beyond simple constant substitution.

## 8.2 Resolving the Need for Dark Matter (Galactic Dynamics)

The primary observational impetus for Dark Matter arises from the discrepancy between observed flat galactic rotation curves and predictions from Newtonian gravity or GR applied solely to the visible baryonic matter. Standard models resolve this by postulating vast, unseen halos of non-interacting Dark Matter particles. Infomatics, however, attributes this discrepancy entirely to the inadequacy of applying standard gravitational laws on galactic scales. The resolution lies in applying the correct **emergent π-φ gravity** detailed in Section 7. This theory, arising from the fundamental structure of the informational field I and characterized by $G \propto \pi^3/\phi^6$, inherently differs from standard GR. Its application to rotating systems must respect the intrinsically cyclical (π-governed) nature of galactic dynamics, which standard calculations often neglect. Furthermore, the effective gravitational interaction in the complex environment of a galaxy might exhibit scale-dependent behavior related to φ or non-linearities arising from the underlying κ-field dynamics, leading to deviations from standard GR predictions at large radii. **Infomatics predicts that a quantitative calculation using the full π-φ gravitational dynamics for a realistic baryonic disk galaxy will reproduce the observed flat rotation curves without any need for non-baryonic Dark Matter.** The "missing mass" is thus interpreted as an artifact of using an incomplete or incorrect theory of gravity rooted in potentially flawed foundational assumptions. Performing these detailed galactic dynamics calculations is a key objective for Phase 3.

## 8.3 Resolving the Need for Dark Energy (Cosmic Acceleration)

The inference that the universe's expansion is accelerating, commonly attributed to Dark Energy (Λ), primarily relies on interpreting Type Ia supernovae apparent magnitudes ($m$) versus redshift ($z$) within the standard ΛCDM model using the idealized, homogeneous FLRW metric. Infomatics challenges this interpretation fundamentally through several mechanisms. Firstly, the **distance-redshift relation** itself must be re-derived. Standard cosmology assumes conventional light propagation ($h, c$) through a smooth FLRW spacetime yields $1+z = a_0/a(t)$. Infomatics replaces this with informational patterns (Î) propagating at speed $c=\pi/\phi$ through an emergent, *inhomogeneous* spacetime governed by π-φ dynamics. The relationship between observed redshift $z$ (representing cumulative frequency shift during propagation through the evolving κ-field) and distance must be recalculated within this framework and is unlikely to match the simple FLRW formula, potentially explaining supernova dimming without acceleration.

Secondly, even if acceleration is real, the **modified expansion dynamics** governed by the π-φ Friedmann equation ($H^2 \propto (\pi^4/\phi^6) \rho_{info}$) offer intrinsic mechanisms beyond an ad-hoc Λ. These include potentially non-standard evolution of the informational density $\rho_{info}$ itself, perhaps coupled to the universe's changing resolution scale ε. Another possibility is a non-zero **π-φ vacuum energy** contribution derived naturally from the fundamental scales (e.g., $\rho_{vac} \propto E_P / \ell_P^3 \sim \pi\phi^4$), which avoids the $10^{120}$ discrepancy of the standard Λ problem and might drive late-time acceleration. Finally, the full equations governing $a(\tau)$ derived from the complete π-φ Lagrangian might contain terms intrinsically leading to acceleration when $\rho_{info}$ becomes dilute, representing a modification of gravity on cosmological scales. **Infomatics predicts that a correct analysis incorporating these factors—a revised $z$-$d_L$ relation and the modified π-φ gravitational dynamics—will quantitatively explain the supernova data and other evidence for acceleration without invoking a separate Dark Energy field (Λ).**

## 8.4 Consistency with BBN and CMB

The Infomatics cosmological model must also demonstrate consistency with other key observational pillars: Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). BBN requires the correct expansion rate ($H$) and particle interaction rates during the universe's first few minutes to produce the observed light element abundances. Infomatics must yield the correct $H$ from its modified Friedmann equation and the correct interaction rates using the geometric amplitude $F$ (Section 6). The CMB's near-perfect thermal spectrum should emerge from the initial state of I, while its specific anisotropy pattern must be reproduced by evolving initial κ-field fluctuations according to π-φ gravity and interaction rules (without DM/DE). Achieving this consistency requires detailed Phase 3 calculations. The framework's potential ability to handle Planck-scale physics smoothly might also offer advantages in modeling the very early universe relevant to CMB origins and potentially resolving the Trans-Planckian Problem.

## 8.5 Conclusion on Cosmology

Infomatics offers a parsimonious and potentially complete framework for cosmology, directly addressing foundational critiques of the standard ΛCDM model. By deriving gravity ($G \propto \pi^3/\phi^6$) and the speed limit ($c = \pi/\phi$) from fundamental geometric principles {π, φ} and eliminating artifactual constants like $h$, it provides concrete mechanisms to explain galactic rotation curves and cosmic acceleration without invoking the hypothetical entities of Dark Matter and Dark Energy. These phenomena are reinterpreted as consequences of applying the correct emergent π-φ gravitational dynamics and re-evaluating light propagation within an emergent spacetime framework governed by fundamental geometric principles. Quantitative verification requires detailed calculations (Phase 3), but Infomatics provides a consistent theoretical basis for resolving these major cosmological anomalies.
