# 10. Reinterpreting Quantum Phenomena via Information Dynamics

**(Operational Framework v2.5)**

## 10.1 Rejecting Quantization, Reinterpreting Phenomena

The body of observations typically categorized under **quantum mechanics (QM)** reveals behaviors at microscopic scales fundamentally different from classical expectations. While standard QM formalism provides accurate predictions, its foundational postulate of energy quantization ($E=hf$), introduced historically by Planck as a mathematical necessity without physical derivation, imposes discreteness *a priori*. Infomatics, built upon a continuous informational field (I) governed by π and φ (Section 2), **fundamentally rejects inherent quantization**. It asserts discreteness is **emergent**, arising when interactions, characterized by a resolution ε (Section 3), selectively actualize stable resonant patterns (Î) defined by integer indices $(n, m)$ (Section 3). This section reinterprets core "quantum" phenomena within this continuum-based operational framework, replacing Planck's constant $h$ with the **geometric action scale φ** (Section 4) and interaction constants like α with the **geometric amplitude A<sub>geom</sub>** (Section 6), aiming to resolve QM's paradoxes by addressing their potentially artifactual foundation.

## 10.2 Superposition as Potential Contrast (κ) Landscape

In Infomatics, quantum superposition describes the state of **potential contrast (κ)** within the continuous field I associated with a system *before* a resolving interaction. The mathematical representation (analogous to the wavefunction Ψ) maps this landscape of potentiality – the inherent potential for different, mutually exclusive manifest resonant patterns (Î, characterized by specific n, m) to be actualized. Complex coefficients in this representation quantify the intensity or propensity (related to κ) for each possible $(n, m)$ outcome. Interference phenomena arise directly from the superposition and evolution of these potentialities within the continuous field I, governed by the underlying π-φ dynamics, before resolution occurs.

## 10.3 Apparent Quantization as Stable Π-φ Resonance Selection

Observed discrete values (energy levels, spin components, charge) are **emergent properties of stable resonances**. Within the continuous field I, only certain **resonant informational patterns (Î)** – specific configurations characterized by integer indices $(n, m)$ reflecting π-cyclicity and φ-scaling/stability – are stable solutions to the fundamental π-φ dynamic equations (Phase 3 goal). These are analogous to discrete harmonics on a continuous string. An interaction occurring at a specific **resolution (ε ≈ π<sup>-n<sub>int</sub></sup>φ<sup>m<sub>int</sub></sup>)** preferentially actualizes or selects these stable $(n, m)$ modes from the continuum of potentiality. The discreteness measured is therefore an artifact of selectively resolving these specific, stable resonant modes via an ε-dependent process. The energy associated with these modes scales with the geometric action unit $\phi$, not $h$ (e.g., $E_n \approx (n+1/2)\phi\omega$ structure for QHO, Section 5).

## 10.4 Measurement as Resolution (ε) of Contrast (κ) - No Collapse

The measurement problem is resolved by understanding measurement as an **interaction process leading to κ-resolution**, eliminating the need for wavefunction collapse. An apparatus, characterized by its operational **resolution (ε)**, probes the potential contrast (κ) landscape within I associated with possible $(n, m)$ states of the system. This interaction forces the continuous potentiality to resolve into a specific, discrete **manifest informational pattern (Î)** – an actualized contrast κ corresponding to a definite $(n, m)$ outcome – distinguishable *at that resolution ε*. The definite outcome emerges relative to the interaction context (the specific $(n, m)$ properties probed). Probabilism arises from varying propensities encoded in the κ landscape for different $(n, m)$ states, with the finite-ε interaction actualizing one outcome based on these propensities, calculable via the geometric amplitude $A_{geom}$ (Section 6). Measurement is an objective physical process of information actualization.

## 10.5 Spin as Intrinsic Geometric/Topological Structure

Intrinsic angular momentum (spin), quantized in units of the action scale $\phi$ (e.g., ±φ/2 for fermions), represents a fundamental type of **potential contrast (κ)** related to the intrinsic **topological or geometric structure** of the resonant pattern Î itself, characterized by the cyclical index $n$. Spin-1/2 fermions likely correspond to $n=2$ (prime), potentially reflecting a structure requiring a $4\pi$ rotation (two π-cycles) to return to identity. Spin-1 bosons correspond to $n=1$, and Spin-0 scalars to $n=0$. Quantization arises because only these specific structural/topological modes $(n)$ are stable solutions for different particle types according to the π-φ dynamics. Measurement resolves the potential contrast κ between these allowed internal structural states.

## 10.6 Wave-Particle Duality as Resolution-Dependent Manifestation

Apparent wave-particle duality is dissolved as an artifact of classical concepts. It reflects different **manifestations (Î)** of the same underlying informational resonance (e.g., photon Î<sub>γ</sub>, $n=1, m=0$), observed through interactions with different **emergent resolutions (ε)**. **Wave-like behavior** (interference, diffraction) reveals the continuous evolution of the potential contrast (κ) landscape when probed at coarse resolution (large ε, small $n_{int}$). **Particle-like behavior** (localized detection) reflects the actualized, discrete pattern (Î) emerging when interaction occurs at fine spatial resolution (small ε, large $n_{int}$). The manifestation depends entirely on the interaction's resolution ε probing the underlying $(n, m)$ resonance structure within the continuous field I.

## 10.7 Uncertainty Principle from Complementarity and Action Scale φ

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle reflects a fundamental **complementarity arising from resolving information from the continuous field I via finite resolution ε**, governed by the **geometric action scale φ**. Conjugate variables like position ($x$) and momentum ($p$) correspond to probing complementary aspects of the potential contrast (κ) landscape. The fundamental commutation relation within Infomatics becomes $[\hat{x}, \hat{p}] = i\phi$ (replacing $\hbar$), directly leading to an uncertainty relation $\Delta x \Delta p \ge \phi/2$. This signifies an intrinsic trade-off: an interaction designed to precisely resolve one aspect (e.g., position, requiring fine $\varepsilon_x \sim \pi^{-n_x}\phi^{m_x}$) inherently limits the simultaneous resolution of the complementary aspect (momentum, $\varepsilon_p \sim \phi/\varepsilon_x$). It's a fundamental limit on extracting complementary information from the continuum via any finite-ε interaction.

## 10.8 Summary: Quantum Phenomena from Information Dynamics

Infomatics reinterprets quantum phenomena via **information dynamics within the continuous reality field I, governed by abstract geometric principles π and φ, and mediated by emergent resolution ε.** Superposition is potential contrast κ. Quantization is emergent π-φ resonance characterized by $(n, m)$. Measurement is κ-resolution via ε, without collapse. Spin reflects intrinsic $(n, m)$ structure/topology. Wave-particle duality is ε-dependent manifestation. Uncertainty arises from complementarity governed by the geometric action scale $\phi$. Interactions are governed by the calculable geometric amplitude $A_{geom}$. This offers a coherent, continuum-based foundation, resolving paradoxes by eliminating *a priori* quantization ($h$) and grounding physics in interaction and information geometry.
