*(Note: "Derived" indicates a result obtained through logical/mathematical steps from postulates within the framework. "Hypothesis" indicates a specific proposed relationship requiring further derivation or testing. "Postulate" indicates a foundational assumption. "Empirical Fit" indicates a parameterization based directly on observation used to support a hypothesis. Proportionality constants are often omitted where they require Phase 3 derivation.)*
