**Decimal Representation and Artificial Concepts: Zero, Negatives, and Imaginaries**

Building upon the anthropocentric and non-universal origins of base-10 counting established previously, we now examine the consequences embedded within the *representational system* derived from it–the standard **decimal system**–and associated mathematical constructs commonly employed. While operationally powerful, this conventional toolkit introduces specific limitations and potentially unphysical idealizations when used to describe the natural world.

The standard **decimal representation**, the method of expressing quantities using powers of ten and positional notation, introduces profound limitations when attempting to describe continuous physical reality or even simple ratios. The system excels at representing integers and those rational numbers whose denominators (in lowest terms) contain only the prime factors 2 and 5. However, due to base-10 possessing only four divisors (1, 2, 5, 10), many simple and frequently encountered fractions result in **infinite repeating decimal representations** (e.g., 1/3 = 0.333..., 1/6 = 0.166..., 1/7 = 0.142857...). This mathematical reality necessitates **truncation and approximation** in practical computation whenever exact fractional values involving these denominators are required. While often sufficient for engineering or everyday scales, this introduces an inherent **approximation error** at the most basic level of description. In fields like fundamental physics and cosmology, where extreme precision is required or where effects are integrated over vast scales or complex iterations, the cumulative effect of these seemingly minuscule truncation errors can become significant, potentially introducing systematic deviations and artifacts that obscure the true underlying behavior.

Within this decimal framework, conventional mathematics also employs several conceptual constructs whose status as direct representations of physical reality is highly questionable. The concept and symbol **zero (0)** is perhaps the most profound and problematic. Mathematically, it functions crucially as both a **placeholder** in positional notation (e.g., distinguishing 101 from 11) and as the **additive identity** (a + 0 = a). It’s important to recognize the distinction here: While the revolutionary development of positional notation and the placeholder zero (primarily attributed to Indian mathematicians) provided the computational efficiency we rely on today, these innovations are fundamentally **base-independent** mathematical concepts. Their genius lies in the abstract structure **applicable to any base**. The historical success of the decimal system resulted from applying these powerful, base-agnostic innovations to the readily available, anatomically convenient base-10 scaffold, not from proof of the scaffold’s own inherent superiority. However, the *interpretation* of zero as representing absolute physical **“nothingness,”** a complete void, or a **dimensionless point** of null extension runs into immediate conflict with physical observation and theoretical consistency. The quantum vacuum, for instance, is not a state of true nothingness but possesses zero-point energy and undergoes constant fluctuations. Furthermore, treating zero as a reachable point value in physical equations often leads directly to **mathematical singularities**. The $1/r^2$dependence of Newtonian gravity or Coulomb’s law predicts infinite force at $r=0$; classical general relativity predicts infinite curvature and density at the Big Bang ($t=0$in some models) and within black holes ($r=0$in simple coordinates). These infinities are widely regarded as signals of theoretical breakdown rather than descriptions of physical reality, arising precisely because the mathematical framework allows division by, or approach to, an absolute zero point that may not have a physical counterpart.

Similarly, **negative numbers**, while essential for algebra and accounting, present ontological difficulties when applied to fundamental physical quantities. Mathematically, they extend the number line linearly below zero. Physically, however, what does intrinsically “negative mass,” “negative length,” or “negative absolute temperature” (below zero Kelvin) truly mean? In most physical contexts, negativity appears to represent a **relative direction, an opposition, or a deficit** compared to a chosen reference point or convention (e.g., velocity, charge, potential energy). The concept of negative numbers might be an artifact of imposing a specific structure (explored in Section 1-4) onto physical properties that are perhaps more fundamentally described by **magnitudes and relationships** or **directedness within a cyclical or relational structure**. Assuming negative numbers represent fundamental physical states equivalent to their positive counterparts risks ontological confusion.

The introduction of **imaginary and complex numbers**, based on the imaginary unit $i = \sqrt{-1}$, represents another layer of mathematical abstraction whose fundamental physical necessity can be questioned. Complex numbers are undeniably powerful and elegant tools, particularly in describing oscillations, waves, and the formalism of quantum mechanics (where state amplitudes are complex). However, does their utility imply that an “imaginary” dimension is fundamental to reality? Or does the need for $i$arise from attempting to represent **intrinsically rotational or phase-dependent phenomena** using algebraic methods built primarily on the one-dimensional real number line? Alternative mathematical frameworks, such as **geometric algebra (Clifford algebra)**, demonstrate that complex numbers and their operations (particularly rotations) can often be represented using only geometrically “real” entities (vectors, bivectors representing planes of rotation) within a higher-dimensional algebraic structure. For instance, the role of $i$in $e^{i\theta}$for rotations can be replaced by a geometric bivector $I$such that $I^2 = -1$, representing the plane of rotation itself. Their ontological status as fundamental components of reality, rather than powerful mathematical constructs within a specific descriptive system, remains an open question warranting critical assessment.

These number constructs–the decimal system with its representational limits, the concept of physical nullity embodied in zero, negative quantities as fundamental states, and imaginary units–form key components of our standard mathematical toolkit. Their abstract origins and potential mismatch with physical reality raise critical questions, particularly when embedded within the assumed geometric framework of linearity, which we examine next.
