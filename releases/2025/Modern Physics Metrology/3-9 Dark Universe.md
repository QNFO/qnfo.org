# Part 3, Section 9: “Dark Universe”

**Undermining the Foundational Justification for a Flawed Paradigm**

The standard model of cosmology, ΛCDM, while achieving remarkable concordance with diverse astronomical observations, rests on the extraordinary assertion that approximately 95% of the universe’s energy density consists of unknown entities: cold dark matter (CDM ≈ 27%) and dark energy (Λ ≈ 68%). This reliance on a dominant, unexplained “dark sector” warrants rigorous scrutiny, suggesting potential flaws not necessarily in the observations themselves, but in the foundational assumptions and descriptive frameworks used for their interpretation. This section argues that the perceived necessity for dark matter and dark energy stems directly from **fundamental flaws, invalid assumptions, and mathematical/metrological artifacts embedded within the standard descriptive paradigm itself**, thereby attempting to **undermine the justification** for invoking this “dark universe.”

The inference of **dark matter** arises primarily from the quantitative failure of standard gravity (Newtonian or general relativity) to explain observed galactic dynamics, particularly flat rotation curves ($v_{\text{obs}}(r) \approx \text{constant}$), using only visible baryonic mass ($M_{\text{vis}}$). The standard calculation, $v_{\text{pred}}^2(r) = G M_{\text{vis}}(<r) / r$, consistently predicts velocities that fall off with radius far faster than observed, necessitating the postulation of massive, non-interacting CDM halos. This necessity is argued here to be **likely artifactual**, arising from a **fundamental geometric and mathematical mismatch**. As discussed (Sections 4, 5), applying standard gravitational laws–formulated using calculus and coordinate systems optimized for linear or simple radial symmetries–to intrinsically **cyclical, rotating disk galaxies** potentially governed by π-related dynamics constitutes a misapplication of the mathematical framework. This misapplication **systematically generates a quantitative shortfall** in predicted gravitational effects compared to observations, an error term which is then misinterpreted as requiring vast amounts of unseen matter (CDM). Furthermore, the interpretation of galactic dynamics relies on General Relativity, whose application in this context is problematic, yet the framework itself is implicitly validated by a **metrological system (Sections 7, 8) that enshrines constants ($c$, and $G$implicitly via the definition of mass through $h$) derived from and consistent with these standard theories.** The need for CDM is thus identified as likely arising from flawed calculation within a potentially inappropriate descriptive system, reinforced by the self-referential nature of our measurement standards.

The inference of **dark energy (Λ)** from Type Ia supernovae relies on interpreting their apparent dimming at various redshifts–$m(z)$–within the idealized **Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric**. This interpretation, which indicates an accelerating cosmic expansion requiring an energy component with negative pressure ($\Omega_\Lambda \approx 0.7$), is **highly questionable** due to multiple, compounding flaws. Firstly, the **FLRW metric’s core assumption of perfect homogeneity and isotropy is demonstrably false** on scales relevant to light propagation. Applying this overly smooth, idealized metric to interpret light traveling through our lumpy, inhomogeneous universe introduces **uncorrected systematic errors due to averaging and backreaction**, potentially invalidating the simple luminosity distance calculation–$d_L(z)$–used to infer acceleration. Secondly, the interpretation rests entirely on the standard understanding of **cosmological redshift ($z$)** arising exclusively from metric expansion acting on light treated as discrete photons whose energy ($E=h\nu$) and propagation are governed by standard QM/GR. This model, rooted ultimately in Planck’s quantization postulate (Section 7), assumes photons travel effectively unchanged between interactions across vast cosmic distances according to these standard laws. If this model of quantized light interacting with an expanding spacetime is incomplete, or if quantization itself is an emergent phenomenon rather than inherent (as critiqued in Section 7), the standard $z$-distance relation–$d_L(z)$–derived within the FLRW framework **loses its foundational validity**, thereby invalidating the inference of acceleration from supernova data. Thirdly, identifying the required accelerating component with a physical **cosmological constant Λ representing vacuum energy is definitively challenged by the cosmological constant problem**. The $10^{60}-10^{120}$order-of-magnitude discrepancy between the observationally inferred Λ and theoretical predictions from quantum field theory represents a catastrophic failure of the standard theoretical framework, a failure largely ignored when Λ is invoked as dark energy. Moreover, this entire interpretive chain–from measuring supernova fluxes and redshifts to calculating distances using $d_L(z)$within FLRW–**operates within the modern SI metrological system (Sections 7, 8). In this system, fundamental constants like the speed of light $c$(governing distance via $d=ct$) and Planck’s constant $h$(underpinning the quantum description of light and energy) are fixed by definition.** This creates a self-consistent loop that implicitly validates the potentially flawed assumptions about geometry (FLRW) and light propagation (standard QM/GR interpretation of redshift) used in the calculation, preventing empirical refutation of these core assumptions from within the system and reinforcing the apparent need for Λ.

This forensic analysis demonstrates that the standard cosmological model’s reliance on dark matter and dark energy is predicated on questionable assumptions and potential mathematical and metrological artifacts. The perceived need for dark matter appears likely an artifact of applying geometrically inadequate gravitational laws to rotating systems, reinforced by metrologically enshrined constants. The perceived need for dark energy appears likely an artifact of interpreting observations through an overly idealized geometric model (FLRW) using a potentially flawed understanding of cosmological redshift derived from standard interpretations of quantum physics (rooted in $h$), compounded by the theoretical absurdity of the cosmological constant Λ, all operating within a self-validating metrological system based on fixed $c$and $h$. Therefore, this analysis concludes that the **justification for the “dark universe” paradigm**, requiring CDM and Λ as fundamental constituents, **is critically undermined** by the internal inconsistencies and questionable foundational assumptions of the theoretical and metrological framework used to infer their existence. Cosmological observations, while valid data points, demand re-evaluation within a potentially more fundamental descriptive framework, one potentially free from the identified mathematical and metrological constraints.
