## Footnotes:

1.  Via Holographic Principle/AdS/CFT, information on boundary is key, but ontology usually strings/branes.
2.  Causal sets are discrete relations; information content is central but primacy debated.
3.  Twistor space encodes spacetime geometry informationally/geometrically, but ontology is complex.
4.  Classical spacetime continuum assumed (GR part). Fields are quantum.
5.  Fundamental continuous field I; emergent discrete patterns Î.
6.  Usually assumes continuous background spacetime for strings/branes.
7.  Spacetime geometry fundamentally discrete (spin network states).
8.  Based on discrete algebraic structure of E8 group.
9.  Based on discrete grid/states/rules (e.g., cellular automata).
10. Spacetime is fundamentally a discrete partial order (causal set).
11. Twistor space is a complex continuum; spacetime emerges.
12. Assumes underlying continuous vector space/manifold for GA operations.
13. φ appears in some string compactifications or dualities, but not usually axiomatic. π is inherent in oscillations/geometry.
14. φ inherent in E8 structure. π less central?
15. π inherent via complex numbers/spinors. φ not typically fundamental.
16. GA naturally handles rotations (π) and could potentially model scaling (φ), but π, φ aren't usually the *axioms*.
17. Quantization ($h$) is a core postulate of QM/QFT part.
18. Discreteness arises from stable π-φ resonances in continuous field I.
19. String vibrations/energy levels are quantized axiomatically.
20. Geometric operators (area, volume) have discrete spectra derived from quantizing GR.
21. Particle states are discrete elements of E8 representations. Quantization origin linked to group discreteness?
22. Reality is fundamentally discrete states/rules.
23. Discreteness is fundamental (causal set elements). Energy/matter quantization less clear.
24. Quantization arises from sheaf cohomology / representation theory in twistor space.
25. Quantization often imposed via standard methods on GA fields, but potential for emergent quantization exists.
26. Replaces $\hbar$ with geometric action scale $\phi$.
27. Often aims to derive physics from simple rules, potentially avoiding $h$, but not always explicit.
28. Some GA approaches attempt reformulation without $\hbar$, others incorporate it.
29. $c, G$ are inputs/defined; α is input/measured.
30. $c, G$, Planck scales derived from π, φ. α<sub>eff</sub> derived from dynamics (Phase 3 goal).
31. String scale α' and coupling g<sub>s</sub> are inputs. $c, G$ emerge in low energy limit. α potentially calculable from compactification? (Landscape problem).
32. Aims to derive all constants/ratios from E8 structure constants.
33. Constants likely emergent properties of the computational rules/evolution.
34. Fundamental scales might be discrete units, standard constants emergent.
35. Constants potentially emerge from twistor geometry/cohomology.
36. Constants usually input, but potential to derive ratios geometrically.
37. Masses/generations are input parameters (Yukawa couplings).
38. Mass hierarchy predicted from φ-scaling ($M \propto \phi^m$, $L_m$ primality rule).
39. Generations potentially from topology of compactification; hierarchy from geometry/fluxes? (Landscape problem).
40. Particle states correspond to E8 representations; hierarchy/generations must emerge from group structure/breaking.
41. Particle patterns emerge; hierarchy depends on specific rules.
42. Particle states potentially related to twistor cohomology; hierarchy mechanism unclear.
43. Potential to explain hierarchy via geometric stability/resonance rules.
44. Gravity described by GR, a fundamental geometric theory (to be quantized).
45. Emergent large-scale geometry of field I, governed by π, φ.
46. Emerges as the massless spin-2 closed string mode.
47. Emerges directly from quantization of spacetime geometry (spin foams).
48. Included as part of the E8 algebraic structure.
49. Must emerge from large-scale behavior of the discrete computation.
50. Spacetime/gravity emerge from the causal order/number of elements.
51. Spacetime/gravity emerge from the structure of twistor space.
52. Gravity often modeled via gauge principles within GA.
53. Aims to explain galactic dynamics via modified π-φ gravity.
54. Supersymmetry/axions are candidates, but not required by core theory.
55. Modified GR at quantum level might affect cosmology.
56. Depends on specific causal set dynamics/cosmology model.
57. Aims to explain acceleration via π-φ dynamics or vacuum structure.
58. Landscape of vacua offers explanation via specific flux compactifications, but lacks predictability.
59. Quantum corrections to GR might yield effective Λ or modified dynamics.
60. Some causal set models naturally incorporate positive Λ.
61. Requires adding an interpretation (Copenhagen, MWI, Bohmian, etc.).
62. Explained via resolution ε actualizing potential κ based on interaction context.
63. Depends heavily on whether computation is classical/quantum, deterministic/probabilistic.
64. Twistor theory offers different perspectives on QM foundations, potentially impacting measurement.
65. GR part is background dependent until fully quantized; SM uses fixed background.
66. Dynamics of field I define emergent spacetime; fundamentally background independent.
67. Often formulated on background spacetime, but AdS/CFT offers background independence via duality. Background independence is a goal.
68. E8 algebra exists independently of spacetime background.
69. Depends: CA on fixed grid is background dependent; some models aim for emergent spacetime.
70. Twistor space is the primary arena, spacetime emerges.
71. Infomatics v3 *postulated* π, φ as foundational but failed. IO aims to see if they *emerge* naturally from dynamics/rules, rather than imposing them. The goal (✅) would be derivation, but the foundational status is currently uncertain (❓).
