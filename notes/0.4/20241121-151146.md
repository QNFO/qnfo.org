Draft a reasonable accommodation request under the Americans with Disabilities Act to the San Francisco Superior Court for legal counsel considering that my disability and anger management problems have made it difficult for me to navigate the system on my own and in fact I was evicted and I lost my attorney because I was unable to represent myself pro se due to my disability.

> Dear Honorable Court,
> I am writing to request reasonable accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in connection with my legal proceedings before this Court. I have a disability that affects my anger management, which has made it extremely difficult for me to navigate the legal system on my own.
> As a result of my disability, I have experienced the following challenges:
> - I was evicted from my residence due to my inability to control my anger.
> - I lost my attorney and was unable to represent myself pro se due to my disability.
> These challenges have significantly hindered my ability to access justice and protect my legal rights. I believe that reasonable accommodations would enable me to participate fully in the legal process.
> Specifically, I request the following accommodations:
> - **Appointment of a pro bono attorney:** I request that the Court appoint a pro bono attorney to represent me in my legal proceedings. An attorney would provide me with the necessary legal guidance and support to navigate the complex legal system.
> I understand that the Court has a duty to provide reasonable accommodations to individuals with disabilities. I believe that the accommodations I have requested are reasonable and necessary to ensure that I have equal access to justice.
> I am committed to complying with all court orders and participating fully in my legal proceedings. I am confident that with the appropriate accommodations, I can effectively represent myself and protect my legal rights.
> Thank you for your consideration of my request.
> Sincerely,

Please revise the request above to indicate that in addition to A reasonable accommodation of a pointing counsel, I also request a reasonable accommodation for an advocate appointed by the court that can help me navigate non-legal administrative matters like falling forms on times and understanding the non-lawyer functions.

Also, in the bullet list of consequences, I’ve been unable to fully participate in my own legal representation, even pro se, because of the complexities of navigating the court procedures. And in fact, the record will show, in my eviction case, I was evicted entirely because of procedural matters that could have been handled by a court appointed attorney.

Please also assert, in addition to my ADA rights, my constitutional rights to represent myself and to be appointed with suitable counsel, even in civil matters, because a civil matter could easily lead to a criminal matter as was illustrated by a restraining order brought on by my former landlord’s attorney.

As far as the matter of representing myself, it’s imperative that the court recognized that a default ruling on the matter of procedural technicalities is not what is intended by the Constitution’s guarantee of access to courts. And this is a fundamental miscarriage of justice. As I have noted in my unlawful detainer case that was mute before the court, they simply ignored it. and ruled against me anyway Despite substantive legal questions that the court needed to address, not procedural matters that are trivial.

> 1. The constitutional right to represent yourself and have appointed counsel, even in civil matters.
> 2. The potential for civil matters to lead to criminal consequences.
> 3. The issue of default rulings based on procedural technicalities, which goes against the spirit of constitutional access to courts.
> 4. The specific example from your unlawful detainer case where substantive legal questions were ignored in favor of procedural matters.
> This revised version presents a stronger case for why you need these accommodations and highlights the potential injustices that could occur without them. It also ties your personal experiences to broader constitutional principles of access to justice.
> Is there anything else you’d like to add or modify in this request?
