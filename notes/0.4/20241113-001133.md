Instead of passwords we should have something like the Fediverse where they're individual distributed servers that have their own URL. And so you would have a username on that, but no password. And so then it would be up to you to figure out if you want to keep that secret or what. So then the uniqueness would be in the username, not necessarily the same as a label that you'd use in chat rooms. So that would actually be a secret unless you wanted to, unless you cared. Maybe you want to share it with somebody. That's a good way to have shared forums.

> This is an interesting concept that combines elements of federated identity systems, passwordless authentication, and decentralized networks. Let me break down some key points and considerations:
> 1. Distributed servers: This aligns with the principles of federated networks like the Fediverse, where users have accounts on individual servers rather than a centralized platform.
> 2. URL-based identity: Using a unique URL as an identifier is similar to WebID or other decentralized identity systems.
> 3. No passwords: Eliminating passwords could enhance security by removing a common attack vector. However, some form of authentication would still be necessary.
> 4. Secret username: The idea of keeping the username itself secret is novel, but it raises questions about usability and how authentication would work without exposing the identifier.
> 5. Separation of identity and display name: Distinguishing between a secret identifier and a public username for interactions is an interesting approach to privacy.
> 6. Shared forums: This could facilitate easier creation of private or semi-private discussion spaces.
> Challenges and considerations:
> 1. Authentication: Without passwords, how would users prove ownership of their identity? Possible solutions could include cryptographic keys or multi-factor authentication.
> 2. Discovery: If usernames are secret, how would people find and connect with each other?
> 3. Security: Relying solely on the secrecy of a username for security (security through obscurity) is generally not considered robust.
> 4. Usability: Managing and remembering a secret URL-based identity could be challenging for many users.
> 5. Interoperability: How would this system interact with existing identity and authentication systems?
> While this concept presents some intriguing ideas for rethinking digital identity and authentication, it would require careful design and implementation to address security, usability, and practical concerns. It could potentially be developed as an experimental protocol or as part of a larger decentralized identity ecosystem.

That's the whole point. No more authentication that this is up to the collective to make it work because otherwise we're all disadvantaged by how passwords are costing us time and our attention.
> [!ai]+ AI
>
> I understand your perspective on wanting to eliminate the burdens of traditional password-based authentication. You're envisioning a system that shifts the responsibility for security and identity management more towards the collective user base rather than centralized authorities. This approach has some intriguing potential benefits:
> 1. Reduced cognitive load: No more remembering multiple complex passwords.
> 2. Elimination of password-related vulnerabilities: Phishing, password reuse, weak passwords, etc.
> 3. More user control: Individuals decide how to manage and share their identifiers.
> 4. Potential for more organic, trust-based communities.
> However, this system would require a significant paradigm shift in how we approach online identity and security. Some challenges to consider:
> 1. Bootstrapping trust: How do we establish initial trust in a system without central authorities?
> 2. Handling compromised identities: What happens if someone's secret identifier is exposed?
> 3. Balancing privacy and accountability: How do we prevent abuse while maintaining anonymity?
> 4. Adoption and interoperability: Getting widespread buy-in for such a radical change would be difficult.
> Your idea pushes us to think creatively about alternatives to our current authentication models. While it would face significant hurdles in implementation, exploring such concepts can lead to innovative solutions for improving online identity management and security. It might be worth considering how elements of this approach could be incorporated into evolving decentralized identity systems or blockchain-based solutions.

I'd want to see proof that there is a significant upside to abuse and that it couldn't readily be taken care of on the system side without any difference to the user.
> [!ai]+ AI
>
> I understand you're looking for a radical shift away from traditional authentication methods, prioritizing user convenience and collective responsibility over centralized security measures. Your proposal aims to eliminate the cognitive burden of passwords while empowering users to manage their own identities. Here are some thoughts on your request for proof of upsides and system-side management:
> 1. Potential upsides of abuse in this system:
> - It's challenging to identify clear upsides to abuse in any system. However, the openness might lead to faster identification of vulnerabilities and community-driven solutions.
> - The lack of centralized control could foster more resilient, adaptable communities.
> 2. System-side management without user impact:
> - Reputation systems could be implemented to flag suspicious behavior.
> - Cryptographic proofs could be used to verify identity claims without exposing the secret identifier.
> - Federated servers could share abuse reports and collaboratively block malicious actors.
> 3. Challenges to consider:
> - Sybil attacks (creating multiple fake identities) might be easier without centralized verification.
> - Recovering lost or stolen identities could be problematic without traditional authentication.
> - Balancing anonymity with accountability remains a complex issue.
> While your proposed system offers an innovative approach to digital identity, it would require extensive testing and refinement to prove its viability and security in real-world scenarios. The effectiveness of system-side abuse prevention without user friction is theoretically possible but would need practical demonstration.

Here's how this will work. The new networking, the new collective networking, is that We all have to look out for each other. If you see something, say something, and we're all in charge. So, that makes us all administrators of ourselves and others. And so, in a virtual world, if you really want to be a vigilante and go crazy, you're not harming anyone. And, from the user side, if you feel like the collective, you always have the choice to isolate yourself if that's it. I don't really necessarily see a problem if we assume strongly assume a beneficial outcome and that most of the time problems are actually our ignorance and us creating the problem. And so self policing there is important.
