listening to the song “people are people” Reflecting on a text exchange with a friend about my trials and tribulations living in San Francisco and dealing with the disconnected so-called resources here to so-called help people that end up doing exactly the opposite, propping up existing bureaucracies and harming people through an action of social welfare. And after filing four complaints with the city’s human rights commission yesterday against various organizations, I stopped to look at his last message, one of his last messages, which are people need help. And that’s very true. And I’d like to reflect on that.

Me: I have a feeling something good will come of this injustice
Friend: I hope so. People need help

After all, I’ve already been unlawfully fired for going on medical leave, then denied unemployment in Illinois because I live out of state, then denied social security disability benefits, then evicted from my first apartment (with a restraining order used as leverage against me and a pro bono attorney who committed professional malpractice), and then most recently denied general assistance welfare benefits in part because I chose to legally change my name. So, here I am. I persist. Bring it on!

> **Reflection on “People Are People” and the Need for Help**
> Amidst the challenges you’ve faced in San Francisco, the song “People Are People” resonates deeply. It reminds us that despite our differences, we are all human beings in need of support.
> Your friend’s message, “People need help,” underscores this truth. It acknowledges the struggles you’ve endured and the importance of seeking assistance.
> While the so-called resources you’ve encountered have failed you, it’s crucial to remember that there are individuals and organizations genuinely committed to helping those in need.
> Your persistence in filing complaints and seeking justice is a testament to your resilience and determination. It’s a reminder that even in the face of adversity, we must continue to fight for our rights and the well-being of others.
> The injustices you’ve experienced highlight the systemic failures that often prevent people from accessing the help they need. It’s a sobering reminder of the need for reform and a more compassionate approach to social welfare.
> As you continue to navigate these challenges, remember that you are not alone. There are people who care about your well-being and are willing to offer support. Seek out those who can provide guidance, resources, and a listening ear.
> Together, we can work towards a society where everyone has access to the help they need to live a dignified and fulfilling life.

I’d like to write an essay about this in my tone and voice for publication on Medium, Quoting verbatim from the original prompt as much as possible and expanding the thought into a full-fledged incoherent narrative.

> **People Are People: Reflections on Injustice and the Need for Help**
> Amidst the cacophony of San Francisco’s streets, the lyrics of “People Are People” play in the background, a poignant reminder of our shared humanity. As I reflect on a recent text exchange with a friend, his words, “people need help” echo in my ears, carrying a weight that belies their simplicity.
> My journey in this city has been a labyrinth of trials and tribulations. Unlawfully fired, denied unemployment, and evicted from my home, I have faced a relentless barrage of injustices that have tested my resolve. The so-called resources designed to assist those in need have proven to be nothing more than bureaucratic nightmares, propping up existing power structures and harming the very people they claim to serve.
> Yet, through it all, I have persisted. I have filed complaints, sought legal recourse, and refused to be silenced. My friend’s message serves as a beacon of hope, reminding me that even in the face of adversity, there are those who care.
> The injustices I have endured are a stark indictment of a system that fails to provide a safety net for its most vulnerable citizens. The denial of basic assistance based on arbitrary criteria, such as a name change, is a cruel and inhumane act that perpetuates cycles of poverty and despair.
> As I navigate the labyrinth of bureaucracy, I am reminded of the countless others who have been denied the help they desperately need. The homeless man begging for change on the street, the single mother struggling to make ends meet, the disabled veteran denied access to healthcare—their stories are a testament to the systemic failures that plague our society.
> But amidst the darkness, there is hope. There are individuals and organizations who are genuinely committed to helping those in need. They are the unsung heroes who provide food, shelter, and support to those who have been cast aside by the system.
> Their work is a reminder that we are all connected, that we are all part of a human tapestry that binds us together. We’re all just people, trying to get by.
> As I continue to fight for justice, I am bolstered by the knowledge that I am not alone. There are people who believe in me, who support me, and who are willing to stand with me in the face of adversity.
> Together, we can work towards a society where everyone has access to the help they need to live a dignified and fulfilling life. A society where the words “People Are People” are not just a song lyric, but a lived reality.
