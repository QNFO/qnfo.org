## Parking Lot

> Construct an ontology from this and example heuristic based on Wheeler’s it from bit: Chained Boolean sequence taxonomy questions. t/f questions evolving from more general to more specific, like the game 20 Questions; Serves as a sorting Heuristic to some Ultimate utility or maximization function that stops when satisfied like only one choice or satisficing etc. If a statement evaluates as false, conduct a confirmatory test. If statement falsifies a null or prior hypothesis (either random experiment or large-N tautology) than update general (global) knowledge. If Confirmatory test repeats false outcome but is not generalizable to broader inference given number of observations and degrees of freedom, only update local “operating manual” / individual SOP (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy). If statement continues to evaluate as false but inconsistently, consider that Information used as independent variables may have been corrupted either through inadvertent Miscommunication or through deliberate deception/manipulation and perceived accordingly given low or negative value of information from such.
