denying CAAP benefits based on housing status or income sources violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits states from denying any person “within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”

> To support an Equal Protection claim, you would need to show that:
> - You are a member of a protected class (e.g., homeless individuals, individuals with certain income sources).
> - You were treated differently than similarly situated individuals who are not members of the protected class.
> - The different treatment was not justified by a legitimate government interest.
