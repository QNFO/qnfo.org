A new way of working: upscale hotelling. All employees have options for doing their best work wherever they are: remotely or in private suite-style spaces with a mix of complementary workers assigned by algorithm to maximize productivity and worker satisfaction. The key is focusing on the worker as a measure of success not some ambiguous outcome like KPIs or revenue. Environmental variables are optimized to ensure the right worker gets the right environment and, ultimately seamlessly transitions between roles as needed or desired, driven by the employee (like airline flight attendant route bidding)

> **Conclusion:**
> Upscale hotelling is a transformative work model that prioritizes employee well-being and productivity. By focusing on the individual worker, organizations can unlock unprecedented levels of innovation, satisfaction, and success.

Also, for customer and external facing roles, as well as for teams who benefit from meeting together there is a joint preference matching algorithm. For example, if a customer service agent prefers to work at home or a local coffee shop and a customer prefers to meet in person an algorithm will either match with an in person employee and/or optimize the day/time/place of the meeting to best suit all involved.
