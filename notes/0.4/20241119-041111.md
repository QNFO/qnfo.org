Not my democrat anymore. Democrats have lost their way, yet readily criticize Republicans for the same sin. Takes one to know, and you lost this national election fair and square with a bunch of party insiders who’s only job has been politics. Hint: that’s not supposed to be a job, so get off your entitled egos and do something real for a change.
