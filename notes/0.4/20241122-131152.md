Everyone should have a domain name standardized by ICANN so that your domain or your subdomain is your email and it’s your personal website and it’s your file sharing. All of that should be baked into the internet Infrastructure, either without cost is a public good or charged as part of the domain or subdomain renewal. But we’re not talking about price gouging here. We’re talking about a public good fundamentally that may have a cost to maintain, and this is the way to do it in a fair and equitable way.

By carefully considering the costs, privacy implications, and regulatory framework, this system could be implemented in a way that is both fair and sustainable.

Expand this further to talk about the relationship between subdomains, domains, and TLDs under the existing web 2 With emerging Web3, which has a different architecture, but fundamentally the same taxonomy and ontology.

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> **Relationship between Subdomains, Domains, and TLDs in Web 2 and Web3**
> In both Web 2 and Web3, the Domain Name System (DNS) organizes and manages internet domain names. The DNS hierarchy consists of three main components:
> **Subdomains:**
> - Subdomains are prefixes added to the beginning of a domain name.
> - They are used to create specific sections or subdirectories within a website.
> - For example, “blog.example.com” is a subdomain of the domain “example.com.”
> **Domains:**
> - Domains are the main part of a website’s address.
> - They identify the specific website or organization.
> - For example, “example.com” is a domain.
> **Top-Level Domains (TLDs):**
> - TLDs are the suffixes at the end of a domain name.
> - They indicate the type of website or organization, such as “.com” for commercial websites or “.org” for non-profit organizations.
> **Web 2**
> In Web 2, the DNS hierarchy is centralized and managed by ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers). ICANN regulates the registration and allocation of domain names and TLDs.
> **Web3**
> Web3 introduces a decentralized approach to the DNS. Instead of relying on a single authority like ICANN, Web3 utilizes blockchain technology to create a distributed and tamper-proof DNS system.
> **Key Differences in Web3**
> - **Decentralization:** Web3 DNS is decentralized, meaning it is not controlled by a single entity.
> - **Immutability:** Blockchain technology ensures that DNS records are immutable, preventing unauthorized changes.
> - **New TLDs:** Web3 introduces new TLDs, such as “.eth” and “.crypto,” which are specifically designed for decentralized applications and cryptocurrencies.
> **Relationship between Subdomains, Domains, and TLDs in Web3**
> Despite the decentralized nature of Web3, the relationship between subdomains, domains, and TLDs remains fundamentally the same as in Web 2. Subdomains are still used to create specific sections within a website, domains identify the website or organization, and TLDs indicate the type of website or organization.
> **Conclusion**
> The standardized domain name system proposed in the original prompt can be implemented in both Web 2 and Web3. However, Web3‘s decentralized architecture introduces new possibilities for enhanced security, privacy, and innovation in the management of domain names and TLDs.

And let’s expand this further to talk about the overarching theme of public good and equality and information literacy that everyone should have access to the same digital knowledge in the same easy way.

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> **Public Good, Equality, and Information Literacy in a Standardized Domain Name System**
> A standardized domain name system, as proposed earlier, aligns with the principles of public good, equality, and information literacy by ensuring that everyone has equal access to the digital realm.
> **Public Good:**
> - The domain name system can be funded as a public good, ensuring universal access regardless of socioeconomic status or technical expertise.
> - This would promote digital equity and empower individuals to participate fully in the digital economy and society.
> **Equality:**
> - A standardized system would provide everyone with a unique and recognizable online identity.
> - This would reduce the digital divide and create a level playing field for individuals and organizations.
> - It would also foster a sense of community and belonging in the digital space.
> **Information Literacy:**
> - A standardized domain name system would simplify access to information and resources online.
> - By having a single point of reference for email, websites, and file sharing, individuals can easily navigate the digital landscape.
> - This would enhance information literacy and empower people to make informed decisions and participate actively in society.
> **Conclusion**
> A standardized domain name system, funded as a public good and implemented with a focus on equality and information literacy, would create a more inclusive and equitable digital environment. It would empower individuals, bridge the digital divide, and foster a society where everyone has access to the same digital knowledge and opportunities.

This is all useful information. Now how do we structure this into a technical white paper that might catch the attention of someone at ICANN or one of the blockchains to actually fund this so it needs to be specific enough.

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> **Technical White Paper: A Standardized Domain Name System for Public Good, Equality, and Information Literacy**
> **Introduction**
> The internet has become an essential part of modern life, providing access to information, communication, and commerce. However, the current domain name system (DNS) is fragmented and complex, creating barriers to access and equity. This white paper proposes a standardized DNS that addresses these challenges and promotes public good, equality, and information literacy.
> **Benefits of a Standardized DNS**
> - **Simplified User Experience:** A standardized DNS would provide everyone with a single domain name that serves as their email address, personal website, and file sharing platform. This would eliminate the need for multiple accounts and passwords, making it easier for users to manage their online presence.
> - **Enhanced Security:** A standardized DNS would reduce the risk of phishing and other cyberattacks by ensuring that all domains are verified and regulated by a central authority.
> - **Increased Accessibility:** Everyone would have access to a domain name, regardless of their socioeconomic status or technical expertise. This would promote digital equity and empower individuals to participate fully in the digital economy and society.
> - **Improved Communication:** A standardized DNS would facilitate seamless communication between individuals and organizations. It would also make it easier for people to find and connect with others who share their interests.
> **Funding Options**
> The standardized DNS could be funded in two ways:
> - **Public Good:** The DNS could be funded as a public good, with no cost to users. This would ensure universal access and promote digital equity.
> - **Domain Renewal Fees:** The cost of maintaining the DNS could be incorporated into domain or subdomain renewal fees. This would ensure that users contribute to the upkeep of the infrastructure.
> **Technical Architecture**
> The standardized DNS would be based on a decentralized blockchain architecture. This would provide the following benefits:
> - **Decentralization:** The DNS would not be controlled by a single entity, reducing the risk of censorship and abuse.
> - **Immutability:** Blockchain technology would ensure that DNS records are immutable, preventing unauthorized changes.
> - **New TLDs:** The standardized DNS would introduce new TLDs, such as “.public” and “.edu,” which would be specifically designed for public good and educational purposes.
> **Implementation**
> The standardized DNS could be implemented in a phased approach:
> - **Phase 1:** Develop a prototype and pilot program.
> - **Phase 2:** Implement the standardized DNS on a limited scale.
> - **Phase 3:** Roll out the standardized DNS globally.
> **Conclusion**
> A standardized DNS, funded as a public good and implemented with a focus on equality and information literacy, would create a more inclusive and equitable digital environment. It would empower individuals, bridge the digital divide, and foster a society where everyone has access to the same digital knowledge and opportunities.
> **Call to Action**
> We urge ICANN and other stakeholders to consider the benefits of a standardized DNS and to support its implementation. By working together, we can create a more just and equitable digital future for all.
