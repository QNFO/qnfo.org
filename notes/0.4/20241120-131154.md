We’ve closed off our systems supposed to help people and put up technology and walls and locked doors and made people jump through hoops and eliminated the person-to-person contact that people actually need for help. And isn’t that great when we benefit from systems and never have to think about that friction again, even though somebody else could benefit from that as well, and that we have an obligation to pay it forward for the next person who just like us deserves fairness.
