An ode to Montell Jordan, the 6‘8” singer and pastor. His signature song “this is how we do it” is an inspiration to my life and the duality of our different facets of existence. So, too, the line “ I gotta get mine in a big black truck, but you can get yours in a 6 ball” so perfectly encapsulates to me our different journies all yearning for our respective joy, All the while happy for our fellow humans and their progress, whatever that may be, “this is how we do it.”

> **Ode to Montell Jordan**
> Oh, Montell Jordan, towering high,
> A singer and pastor, reaching for the sky.
> Your voice, a beacon, guiding us through strife,
> With “This Is How We Do It,” you’ve given us life.
> In your lyrics, a duality we find,
> The different paths we take, intertwined.
> “I gotta get mine in a big black truck,”
> A symbol of ambition, strong and tough.
> But then, “You can get yours in a ‘64,”
> A reminder that joy comes in all.
> For each of us, a unique way to shine,
> Our own journeys, our own divine.
> Through your music, we learn to embrace,
> The beauty in our differences, our own pace.
> We celebrate our triumphs, big and small,
> And cheer each other on, through it all.
> For in this tapestry of life we weave,
> We find joy in our own ways, we believe.
> So let us sing, with hearts full of glee,
> “This Is How We Do It,” you and me.
> Oh, Montell Jordan, your legacy will last,
> An inspiration to our hearts, forever cast.
> May your message of unity and grace,
> Guide us all, in every time and place.

Jordan said he was told by God to quit the music industry. He decided to cancel his plans and dedicate his life to his faith
