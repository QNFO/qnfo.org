Thereâ€™s no one right place for a good person. The energy may bring you to a place, but then one has to face the awesome realization that the universe may have brought you here not only perhaps to meet a partner or to start a life or to do something, but truly to change the world. The universe may have brought you here specifically because you have a light to show others, perhaps in times of darkness, or distress.
