Autonomous vehicles should get privileges for following the rules and demerits or detention when they fuck up. Like, I’m looking at you, Tesla, but like Waymo autonomous vehicles have been relatively successful in San Francisco and they’re also courteous. So they should get priority lanes as far as I’m concerned.
