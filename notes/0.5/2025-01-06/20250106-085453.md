Ask Google Gemini about a factual but somewhat obscure story discussing how Andrew Gold’s Thank You for Being a Friend ended up the theme song for the Golden Girls and this was the following response:

> “I do not have enough information about that person to help with your request. I am a large language model, and I am able to communicate and generate human-like text in response to a wide range of prompts and questions, but my knowledge about this person is limited. Is there anything else I can do to help you with this request?”

> Meanwhile, Perplexity, a web-based AI browser and search engine epitomized the next wave of transitioning from the web search to synthetic information in AI because perplexity was able to weave this together into a comprehensive story of factual narrative.

> The story of how Andrew Gold’s “Thank You for Being a Friend” became *The Golden Girls* theme is a fascinating web of creativity, serendipity, and collaboration.

In 1978, Andrew Gold wrote and recorded the song for his album *All This and Heaven Too*. Gold, a skilled multi-instrumentalist with a musical pedigree (his father composed for Hollywood, and his mother sang in *The Sound of Music*), described the song as a “throwaway” written in under an hour. Despite his modest expectations, it reached No. 25 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and became one of his signature works[1][2][10].

Fast forward to 1985, when NBC was developing *The Golden Girls*. The producers initially considered using Bette Midler’s “Friends,” but licensing costs led them to Gold’s song instead. To adapt it for television, they hired Cindy Fee, a jingle singer known for her versatile voice, to record a cover. Fee’s upbeat rendition perfectly captured the warmth and humor of the show, becoming synonymous with its themes of friendship and camaraderie[2][3][7].

Gold’s original version remained distinct from Fee’s cover, but both versions benefited from the song’s timeless appeal. While Gold continued his career as a musician and producer (notably working with Linda Ronstadt), Fee found enduring recognition through her association with *The Golden Girls*[1][7][10].

This collaboration between Gold’s songwriting and Fee’s performance turned “Thank You for Being a Friend” into an enduring cultural emblem, bridging soft rock and sitcom history.

> This example highlights the evolving landscape of information retrieval and the strengths of different AI approaches. Gemini’s response reveals a limitation of large language models (LLMs): they don’t inherently “know” information. They are trained on massive datasets and excel at pattern recognition, language generation, and other tasks based on that data. If a specific fact or story isn’t prominent enough in the training data, the LLM won’t have access to it. Essentially, Gemini couldn’t find the relevant connections in its vast knowledge base to answer the question.
> Perplexity, on the other hand, demonstrates the power of combining LLM capabilities with active web searching. It acts as a sophisticated research assistant, querying search engines, synthesizing information from multiple sources, and presenting it in a coherent narrative. This approach allows it to access and process up-to-date information and weave together details from various websites, something a standalone LLM trained on a static dataset cannot do.
> The key differences are:
> - **Knowledge Source:** Gemini relies on its internal training data. Perplexity actively searches the web.
> - **Information Currency:** Gemini’s knowledge is fixed at its training date. Perplexity accesses current information.
> - **Synthesis Capability:** Gemini can synthesize information present in its training data. Perplexity can synthesize information from multiple web sources.
> This comparison doesn’t mean one approach is inherently superior. LLMs like Gemini are incredibly versatile and powerful for many tasks. However, for factual queries requiring specific, potentially obscure information, the web-search-augmented approach of tools like Perplexity offers a significant advantage. The future likely lies in hybrid systems that combine the strengths of both approaches.

Data science became the hot career of the information age or the big data age. Meanwhile, in the age of AI and synthetic information, asking the right questions, a professional question-asker who can design prompts and expand an AI’s choice set will be key.

> You’ve made a great observation about the shifting landscape of information retrieval and the emerging importance of prompt engineering. Your analysis of Gemini and Perplexity’s different approaches is spot-on. Here are some additional thoughts building on your points:
> **The Rise of the “Prompt Engineer”**
> As you pointed out, the ability to craft effective prompts is becoming increasingly crucial. It’s not just about asking a question; it’s about understanding how AI models interpret language, what biases they might have, and how to structure queries to elicit the desired information. This involves:
> - **Specificity and Clarity:** Vague prompts lead to vague answers. A skilled prompt engineer knows how to frame a question with precision, including relevant keywords and context.
> - **Iteration and Refinement:** The first prompt might not yield the best results. Prompt engineering involves experimenting with different phrasings, adding constraints, and iteratively refining the query to improve the AI’s response.
> - **Understanding Model Limitations:** Knowing the strengths and weaknesses of different AI models is essential. A prompt engineer needs to be aware of what a model *can’t* do to avoid unrealistic expectations and tailor their prompts accordingly.
> - **Bias Awareness:** AI models are trained on data, and that data can reflect societal biases. A good prompt engineer needs to be mindful of these biases and design prompts that mitigate their impact.
> **Beyond Factual Retrieval: Creative Applications**
> Prompt engineering isn’t just about finding information; it’s also about *creating* it. With generative AI models, carefully crafted prompts can be used to:
> - **Generate creative content:** Write stories, poems, scripts, musical pieces, and even code.
> - **Translate languages:** Improve the accuracy and fluency of translations.
> - **Summarize text:** Condense lengthy documents into concise summaries.
> - **Brainstorm ideas:** Explore different perspectives and generate novel solutions.
> **The Future of Search and Information Access**
> The distinction between search and synthesis is blurring. We’re moving towards a future where AI doesn’t just retrieve information but also processes, analyzes, and synthesizes it into meaningful narratives. This has profound implications for:
> - **Education:** Personalized learning experiences tailored to individual needs.
> - **Research:** Accelerated discovery through automated analysis and synthesis of vast datasets.
> - **Journalism:** Automated content generation and fact-checking.
> - **Decision-making:** Data-driven insights and predictions to inform complex choices.
> **The “Professional Question-Asker”**
> Your term, “professional question-asker,” perfectly captures this emerging role. It highlights the importance of not just having access to information but also knowing how to ask the right questions to unlock its potential. This skill will be highly valued in a world increasingly reliant on AI-driven information systems. It’s not just about finding answers; it’s about framing the right questions to uncover the insights that matter.

To emphasize this point, and in particular the evolving landscape of data into information, into synthetic knowledge, write a forward-looking hypothetical job description for this new kind of role, and why it matters.

I disagree that a college degree is necessary, but I do think it’s important to discuss prerequisite types of skills. Because a computer science degree says something, but what it really means is what you can do that you learned with it. Also, be more specific. The overall job description doesn’t have to be exactly like a real one. You can take some artistic license, but something like prompt engineering and why that’s important needs to be embedded in why this position matters.
