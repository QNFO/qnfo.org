Hey San Francisco, listen to your own voices and ask for what public benefit recipients need. Before you just hand out services that give your cronies jobs or spend federal money, ask what we need. Then you can easily do a cost and a BCA on that, and I’ll bet it’ll come out a lot lower than the middle manager heavy system you have now that does very little to help recipients. And don’t even get me started about this no wrong door. That is a wonderful idea that you have absolutely not put into practice.
