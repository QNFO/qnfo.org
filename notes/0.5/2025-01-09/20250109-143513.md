 Grids on hills, especially San Francisco’s wacky man versus nature, provides some interesting opportunities for somewhat random experiments on verticality and things like perceived walking between flat streets like near the Embarcadero versus hills like through Van Ness westward.

> You’re right, San Francisco’s unique topography creates a fascinating urban landscape that offers some intriguing opportunities for studying and experiencing verticality in city design. Here are some key points about this:
> 1. Grid vs. Terrain: San Francisco’s grid street pattern, laid out in the 19th century, often ignores the natural contours of the land. This creates dramatic hills and sudden changes in elevation.
> 2. Varied Walking Experiences:
> - Flat areas like the Embarcadero offer a more traditional, level urban walking experience.
> - Hilly streets like those around Van Ness provide a more challenging and varied pedestrian experience.
> 3. Perception of Distance: The effort required to walk up steep hills can make distances feel longer than they actually are.
> 4. Architectural Adaptations: Buildings in San Francisco often have unique designs to accommodate the steep slopes, such as:
> - Garages built into hillsides
> - Stepped foundations
> - Split-level entrances
> 5. Transportation Innovations: The city’s topography led to innovations like cable cars and the California Street cable car line.
> 6. Views and Vistas: The hills create numerous opportunities for dramatic city views and unexpected vistas.
> 7. Microclimates: The varied elevations contribute to San Francisco’s famous microclimates, where weather can differ significantly from one neighborhood to another.
> 8. Urban Planning Challenges: The hills present unique challenges for urban planners in terms of infrastructure, accessibility, and public space design.
> 9. Exercise and Health: The varied terrain can provide built-in exercise for residents, potentially impacting public health.
> 10. Psychological Effects: The constant changes in elevation and perspective can affect how people perceive and interact with their environment.
> These factors make San Francisco an excellent natural laboratory for studying the effects of verticality on urban life, pedestrian behavior, and city design. Researchers and urban planners could conduct interesting experiments comparing flat and hilly areas in terms of walkability, social interaction, property values, and more.
