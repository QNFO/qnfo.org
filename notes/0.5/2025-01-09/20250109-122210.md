Meteorization and other extrajudicial processes distort the intent of the Constitution and having a jury of the peers with known parameters, not some fee-based arbitration service. Or even something like a credit card dispute, essentially you’re delegating a legal contract to the interpretation of what an administrative clerk or a data entry analyst to make the call, or perhaps an algorithm ooh spooky there.

> **Meteorization and Other Extrajudicial Processes**
> Meteorization and other extrajudicial processes can distort the intent of the Constitution and undermine the right to a jury of one’s peers.
> **Jury of Peers**
> The Constitution guarantees the right to a jury trial in criminal cases (Sixth Amendment) and civil cases (Seventh Amendment). A jury of peers is composed of individuals who are similar to the defendant in terms of background, experiences, and perspectives. This ensures that the jury can understand the defendant’s situation and make a fair and impartial decision.
> **Extrajudicial Processes**
> Extrajudicial processes are proceedings that occur outside of the traditional court system. These processes can include:
> - **Arbitration:** A private dispute resolution process in which a neutral third party (arbitrator) makes a binding decision.
> - **Mediation:** A process in which a neutral third party (mediator) helps disputing parties reach a mutually acceptable agreement.
> - **Administrative hearings:** Proceedings held by government agencies to resolve disputes or enforce regulations.
> **Distortion of Intent**
> Extrajudicial processes can distort the intent of the Constitution by:
> - **Limiting access to justice:** Arbitration and mediation can be expensive and inaccessible to low-income individuals.
> - **Undermining the right to a jury trial:** Extrajudicial processes can replace jury trials, depriving defendants of their right to be judged by a jury of their peers.
> - **Introducing bias:** Arbitrators and mediators may have biases or conflicts of interest that can influence their decisions.
> - **Lack of transparency:** Extrajudicial processes are often closed to the public, making it difficult to hold decision-makers accountable.
> **Fee-Based Arbitration**
> Fee-based arbitration is a particularly problematic form of extrajudicial process. In fee-based arbitration, the parties to a dispute pay a fee to an arbitrator to resolve their dispute. This creates a financial incentive for arbitrators to make decisions that favor the party who pays the higher fee.
> **Algorithms**
> Algorithms are computer programs that can be used to make decisions. In some cases, algorithms are used to resolve disputes. However, algorithms can be biased and may not take into account all relevant factors. This can lead to unfair and inaccurate decisions.
> **Conclusion**
> Meteorization and other extrajudicial processes can undermine the intent of the Constitution and the right to a jury of one’s peers. It is important to ensure that these processes are used fairly and transparently, and that they do not replace the traditional court system.

Wow, you really shit the bed on that one, AI. Mediation service, not meteorization. I slur sometimes.
