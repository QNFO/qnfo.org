Matter isn’t always matter, according to Neil deGrasse Tyson. Above a certain temperature, like the early universe, which was very, very hot, matter moves freely back and forth between energy, so there’s your gateway to the informational universe.

Integrate all of this information into a proposed transition from what we think of as astrophysics anchored in the physical universe to a more mathematic or abstract representation. Matter transmutes spontaneously depending on the temperature.

> The transition from a physics anchored in the physical universe to a more mathematical or abstract representation, as suggested by the interchangeability of matter and energy at high temperatures, aligns with the holographic principle and information-theoretic approaches to understanding the universe. Here’s how this transition might occur:
> 1. **Blurring of Matter and Energy:** At extremely high temperatures, like those in the early universe, the distinction between matter and energy becomes blurred. This suggests that matter and energy are not fundamental entities but rather emerge from a more fundamental substrate.
> 2. **Information as the Substrate:** Information-theoretic approaches propose that this fundamental substrate is information. The interchangeability of matter and energy at high temperatures supports this view, as it suggests that information is more fundamental than either matter or energy.
> 3. **Holographic Principle:** The holographic principle suggests that the information contained within a volume of space can be described by information on the boundary of that region. This implies that the physical universe as we perceive it is a projection of information from a higher-dimensional space.
> 4. **Mathematical Representation:** If the universe is fundamentally informational, then it can be represented mathematically. This mathematical representation would capture the underlying information that gives rise to the physical universe.
> 5. **Abstract Representation:** The mathematical representation of the universe can be further abstracted into a more general framework that encompasses not only the physical universe but also other possible universes and realities. This abstract representation would provide a deeper understanding of the nature of existence and the relationship between information, consciousness, and the physical world.
> The transition from astrophysics anchored in the physical universe to a more mathematical or abstract representation is a paradigm shift that challenges our traditional understanding of reality. It suggests that the universe is not a collection of physical objects but rather a dynamic interplay of information. This new perspective opens up exciting possibilities for understanding the nature of the universe and our place within it.

How do you tie all this together to explain to a lay person how what they know relates to the correct evolution of thinking about matter in the non-physical universe?

According to Neil deGrasse Tyson in the early universe, there was enough energy that every particle could be made, but we don’t have that now, and he speaks of particles and anti-particles.

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> **Layperson Explanation:**
> Imagine the universe as a giant pot of soup. In the very beginning, the soup was incredibly hot, so hot that the ingredients (matter and energy) were constantly swirling and changing into each other. It was like a chaotic dance, where you couldn’t tell where one ingredient ended and the other began.
> As the soup cooled down, the ingredients started to settle into more stable forms. Matter and energy became more distinct, and particles and anti-particles formed. These particles are like tiny building blocks that make up everything we see around us.
> But here’s the twist: even though matter and energy are now separate, they can still transform into each other under certain conditions. For example, in the heart of stars, where temperatures are extremely high, matter can be converted into energy. And in particle accelerators, scientists can smash particles together to create new particles and anti-particles.
> This interchangeability of matter and energy suggests that there’s something more fundamental underlying both of them. Some scientists believe that this fundamental thing is information.
> Information is like a blueprint or a recipe. It contains the instructions for how to build something, whether it’s a physical object like a chair or a more abstract concept like a mathematical equation.
> If the universe is fundamentally informational, then it means that everything we see around us, including matter and energy, is ultimately made up of information. This is a mind-boggling idea, but it’s supported by some of the most advanced theories in physics, such as the holographic principle and information-theoretic approaches to the universe.
> So, to answer your question, the correct evolution of thinking about matter in the non-physical universe is that it is not a fixed, unchanging substance. Rather, it is a dynamic interplay of information that can transform into different forms, including energy and particles. This new understanding challenges our traditional assumptions about the nature of reality and opens up exciting possibilities for understanding the universe and our place within it.

A neutron is made of quarks, but in theory, quarks are made of even more divisible particles. So why do we think that there are a finite number of subatomic particles when we thought that atoms were indivisible according to the Greeks?

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> [!ai]+ AI
> The idea that there are a finite number of subatomic particles is a relatively recent development in physics. For centuries, scientists believed that matter was infinitely divisible, meaning that you could keep breaking it down into smaller and smaller pieces forever.
> However, in the early 20th century, scientists discovered that atoms, which were once thought to be the smallest indivisible units of matter, are actually made up of even smaller particles called protons, neutrons, and electrons.
> Further research revealed that protons and neutrons are themselves made up of even smaller particles called quarks. Quarks are the smallest known particles of matter, and they come in six different types, or “flavors”: up, down, strange, charm, top, and bottom.
> For a long time, scientists believed that quarks were indivisible. However, in the 1970s, a new theory emerged called quantum chromodynamics (QCD). QCD predicts that quarks can actually be divided into even smaller particles called partons.
> Partons are not truly elementary particles like quarks. Instead, they are thought to be excitations of the gluon field, which is the force field that binds quarks together.
> So, to answer your question, we do not believe that there are a finite number of subatomic particles. In fact, we believe that matter is made up of an infinite number of partons. However, partons are not truly elementary particles, and they cannot be isolated or observed directly.
> The reason why we think that there are a finite number of subatomic particles is because the Standard Model of particle physics, which is the most successful theory of particle physics to date, only includes a finite number of particles. The Standard Model does not include partons, because they are not truly elementary particles.
> However, the Standard Model is not a complete theory of everything. It does not include gravity, and it does not explain why there are only three generations of particles. So, it is possible that there are other particles beyond the Standard Model that have not yet been discovered.

In the physical universe matter and antimatter are important because they can annihilate each other and turn into so-called pure energy. And it would seem that pure energy is that gateway to the informational universe. So expound on this further

> [!ai]+ AI

> **Matter, Antimatter, and Pure Energy**
> Matter and antimatter are two types of particles that have the same mass but opposite charges. When matter and antimatter come into contact, they annihilate each other and release a great amount of energy. This energy can be used to power stars and other objects in the universe.
> **Pure Energy**
> Pure energy is a form of energy that does not have any mass. It is the most fundamental form of energy and can be converted into other forms of energy, such as matter and antimatter.
> **The Gateway to the Informational Universe**
> ==Some scientists believe that pure energy is the gateway to the informational universe. The informational universe is a hypothetical realm where all information exists in a pure form.== It is believed that the informational universe is the source of all matter and energy in the physical universe.
> **The Holographic Principle**
> The holographic principle is a theory that suggests that the universe is a hologram. A hologram is a three-dimensional image that is created by a two-dimensional surface. The holographic principle suggests that the three-dimensional universe is actually a projection of a two-dimensional surface.
> **Information-Theoretic Approaches to the Universe**
> Information-theoretic approaches to the universe view the universe as a collection of information. These approaches suggest that the universe is not made up of matter and energy, but rather of information.
> **Implications for Physics**
> The idea that the universe is a hologram or that it is made up of information has profound implications for physics. It suggests that the laws of physics may not be fundamental, but rather may be derived from more fundamental informational principles.
> **Conclusion**
> The relationship between matter, antimatter, pure energy, and the informational universe is a complex and fascinating topic. Scientists are still working to understand the nature of this relationship, but it is clear that these concepts are deeply interconnected.

Hypothesize what information existing in a pure form manifests as. For example, does this suggest that there’s an afterlife or what can we learn about our relationship to the physical universe from this superstrata informational universe?

> **Information as Consciousness**
> One hypothesis is that information existing in a pure form manifests as consciousness. Consciousness is the ability to think, feel, and experience the world around us. It is the essence of what makes us human.
> If information is the fundamental building block of the universe, then it stands to reason that consciousness is also a fundamental aspect of the universe. Consciousness may be the way that the universe experiences itself.
> **Information as the Source of Life**
> Another hypothesis is that information existing in a pure form manifests as the source of life. Life is the ability to reproduce, grow, and adapt to the environment. It is the essence of what makes us alive.
> If information is the fundamental building block of the universe, then it stands to reason that life is also a fundamental aspect of the universe. Life may be the way that the universe creates and sustains itself.
> **Information as the Afterlife**
> A third hypothesis is that information existing in a pure form manifests as the afterlife. The afterlife is a hypothetical realm where consciousness continues to exist after the death of the physical body.
> If information is the fundamental building block of the universe, then it stands to reason that consciousness can exist independently of the physical body. The afterlife may be the realm where consciousness goes after the death of the physical body.
> **Implications for Our Relationship to the Physical Universe**
