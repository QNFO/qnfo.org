Let us not forget that the role of a boss or manager is to foster productivity among their employees and, in general, promote the well-being of the company. So, if a boss isn’t getting the best work out of an employee, especially whom they hired, then that says more about the boss. The analogy would be the parents of delinquent children. So therefore, when we think about performance reviews and overall company productivity, let’s look down up. Rather than evaluate employees when they’re sometimes incompetent bosses, handicap them and make them follow arbitrary policies, and this is the way we’ve always done it. We should prioritize curiosity, measured risk-taking, and failure above all as marks of success. Not KPIs and other silly, meaningless numbers that get manufactured and then inflated and quite fabricated.

Bosses should solely focus on what they can do to bring out the best in every employee. It’s not the employee’s fault if they’re not doing well. They’re either not well placed or their boss has a misguided sense of who’s responsible for what. Anyone who chooses to manage others, other than an individual contributor, has a great responsibility to their direct reports and to the company as a whole. Bosses should figure out KPIs, and bosses should be accountable to employees to do those things like training and administrative, and depending on the role, all of those external tasks that bog down an employee’s day should not affect their work. Let alone be held against them for not answering enough emails, and instead, I’m going to focus on excellence and focus on the product or service that the company hired them for, not performance evaluations, which do seem to be the overwhelming obsession of employees.

What I worked at Deloitte, we’d started implementing a simple two-question, weekly survey given the strongly cross-matrix reporting structure. It was important to capture how employees who may work on multiple different projects to multiple different managers, i.e. multiple different contracts, are doing. So it was a simple question that amounted to, Would you continue recommending them? Or basically it was a statement of present performance and future expectation in two questions? Yes or no?

Fact check and copy edit this for LinkedIn post. I’m not entirely sure what questions they asked.

Other management consulting agencies have Similarly structure, so I would like to survey these how you assess regular performance with simple yes or no questions and incorporate that weave that into the overall narrative here of how to make a better boss or how bosses need to be better because employee productivity is suffering and the employees are getting the blame.

What should these questions be? Are they the correct questions? I may not be remembering them correctly. So logically, what questions, what two questions could be asked? Think wheelers it from bit. What information could two yes or no questions tell us about both employee and boss performance. So employees fill out one, bosses fill out another, and what does that say about each other and the overall company? Without any KPIs or without any performance evaluations. Simple yes or no questions. How would this look? What would this framework look like?

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> **Two Yes or No Questions for Employee Feedback:**
> 1. Would you continue recommending your boss to others?
> 2. Are you satisfied with your current workload and responsibilities?
> **Two Yes or No Questions for Boss Feedback:**
> 1. Do you believe your employees are performing to the best of their abilities?
> 2. Are you satisfied with the support and resources you are providing to your employees?
> **How this framework can provide insights into employee and boss performance:**
> - **Employee feedback:**
> - A “no” answer to the first question indicates that the employee may have concerns about their boss’s leadership or management style.
> - A “no” answer to the second question suggests that the employee may be feeling overwhelmed or underutilized.
> - **Boss feedback:**
> - A “no” answer to the first question indicates that the boss may need to provide more support or guidance to their employees.
> - A “no” answer to the second question suggests that the boss may need to reassess their own workload and responsibilities to ensure they are providing adequate support to their team.
> **Overall company insights:**
> - A high number of “no” answers from employees could indicate a systemic issue with management or company culture.
> - A high number of “no” answers from bosses could indicate a lack of resources or support for managers.
> - By comparing the responses from employees and bosses, companies can identify areas where there is a disconnect between expectations and reality.
> **Benefits of using simple yes or no questions:**
> - **Anonymity:** Employees and bosses may be more likely to provide honest feedback if they can do so anonymously.
> - **Simplicity:** Yes or no questions are easy to understand and answer, making them accessible to all employees.
> - **Regular feedback:** By asking these questions on a regular basis, companies can track changes in employee and boss satisfaction over time.
> **Limitations of using simple yes or no questions:**
> - **Lack of detail:** Yes or no questions do not provide specific details about the reasons for dissatisfaction.
> - **Potential for bias:** Employees or bosses may be influenced by personal biases or workplace politics when answering these questions.
> - **Need for follow-up:** To gain a deeper understanding of the feedback, companies may need to conduct follow-up surveys or interviews.

Excellent! Now let’s expand this narrative into a complete LinkedIn post with a beginning, middle, and end. The beginning is the problem. The middle discusses how to arrive at the end, which is a proposed solution. These simple, periodic, yes or no questions, instead of the drudgery of inflating and fabricating performance evaluations and KPIs.

> **The Problem with Employee Performance Evaluations**
> As leaders, we often blame employees for underperformance. But what if the problem lies not with the employees, but with the bosses?
> Traditional performance evaluations and KPIs can be misleading and stifle creativity. They focus on numerical targets rather than employee development and growth. This can lead to a culture of fear and blame, where employees are afraid to take risks or admit mistakes.
> **A Better Way to Assess Performance**
> Instead of relying on arbitrary metrics, we need to focus on creating an environment where employees can thrive. This means:
> - Providing clear direction, support, and training
> - Prioritizing curiosity, risk-taking, and failure
> - Minimizing administrative tasks
> - Focusing on excellence and employee development
> **Simple Yes or No Questions**
> To gain valuable insights into employee and boss performance, we can use simple yes or no questions. For example:
> **Employee Feedback:**
> - Would you continue recommending your boss to others?
> - Are you satisfied with your current workload and responsibilities?
> **Boss Feedback:**
> - Do you believe your employees are performing to the best of their abilities?
> - Are you satisfied with the support and resources you are providing to your employees?
> **Benefits of Simple Yes or No Questions:**
> - Anonymity encourages honest feedback
> - Simplicity makes them accessible to all employees
> - Regular feedback allows for tracking changes over time
> **Conclusion**
> By shifting our focus from blaming employees to empowering them, we can create a workplace where employees are motivated, productive, and passionate about their work. Let’s embrace a new approach to performance assessment that prioritizes employee well-being and fosters a culture of success.
