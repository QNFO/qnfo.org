We are at the Efficient Frontier. We know everything that it is possible to know about the universe at this point in its sequence or in time. This has to happen this way. It’s a progression, a sequence of knowledge. And because of our knowledge, we now have the capability to unlock other parts of the puzzle or discover new layers or This is all part of a grand...

> The Efficient Frontier is a theoretical concept in finance that represents the optimal portfolio of assets that provides the highest possible return for a given level of risk. It is based on the assumption that investors have perfect knowledge of the future and can therefore make optimal investment decisions.
> In the context of the quote, the Efficient Frontier is used as a metaphor for the state of human knowledge. The author argues that we are at a point where we have achieved a deep understanding of the universe and its workings. This knowledge has given us the ability to unlock new layers of reality and discover new possibilities.
> The author suggests that this is all part of a grand design, a plan that is unfolding according to a predetermined sequence. This idea is consistent with the concept of the Efficient Frontier, which assumes that the universe is governed by a set of rules that can be understood and exploited.
> The quote is a reminder that human knowledge is constantly evolving and that we are always on the cusp of new discoveries. It is also a reminder that we are part of a larger plan and that our actions have consequences that extend beyond our own lifetimes.

Apply the same concept to physics and cosmology. How can we push the efficient frontier to new knowledge like the information theoretic approach to the universe and the holographic principle, uniting those with wheelers it from bit into a grand unified theory of everything? How do we keep pushing that efficient frontier?

> The efficient frontier in physics and cosmology represents the boundary of our current knowledge about the universe. It is the point at which we have achieved the deepest possible understanding of the laws of nature and the structure of the cosmos.
> To push the efficient frontier to new knowledge, we need to develop new theories and models that can explain the phenomena that we currently cannot. This may involve developing new mathematical tools, conducting new experiments, or making new observations.
> One promising approach to pushing the efficient frontier is the information theoretic approach to the universe. This approach views the universe as a vast network of information, and it seeks to understand the laws of nature in terms of information theory. The information theoretic approach has the potential to unify different areas of physics, such as quantum mechanics and gravity, and it may lead to new insights into the nature of the universe.
> Another promising approach is the holographic principle. The holographic principle states that the information in a three-dimensional region of space can be encoded on a two-dimensional surface. This principle has implications for our understanding of black holes and the nature of spacetime. The holographic principle may also lead to new insights into the relationship between information and physics.
> By combining these and other approaches, we can push the efficient frontier to new knowledge and achieve a deeper understanding of the universe.
> Here are some specific ways that we can keep pushing the efficient frontier:
> - **Develop new mathematical tools.** New mathematical tools can help us to solve complex problems and develop new theories. For example, the development of calculus in the 17th century led to new insights into the laws of motion and the structure of the universe.
> - **Conduct new experiments.** New experiments can test our existing theories and lead to new discoveries. For example, the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 confirmed the Standard Model of particle physics and opened up new avenues of research.
> - **Make new observations.** New observations can provide us with new data that can be used to test our theories and develop new models. For example, the observation of gravitational waves in 2015 confirmed the existence of gravitational waves and opened up new possibilities for studying the universe.
> By continuing to develop new theories, conduct new experiments, and make new observations, we can push the efficient frontier to new knowledge and achieve a deeper understanding of the universe.

But it didn’t. Just as with chemistry and other fields, now proteins and quarks and subatomic particles, that didn’t actually represent a paradigm shift. So I think pushing the efficient frontier represents a paradigm shift as opposed to just operating within it, which are discoveries.

We have to be willing to take risks that were wrong and to actively falsify ourselves and everything we think we know for that synthesis of what we do know that can push us forward, like making the leap from physics to quantum mechanics, which very much is not physics.
