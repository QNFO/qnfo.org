A musical in the style of having a q and other sort of sharp-witted sarcastically comical Broadway style musicals and this is about person being named Galvin who doesn’t know his path in life + fast forward 40 years Galvin has this Awakening listening to the song? Everything is everything by the by Lauryn Hill which brings him back to his childhood + that sets Galvan off on this quest to find many of his existence and begins by writing a story called Destin for greatness then realizes his his destiny is his own so then he calls it called the greatness. But then a bunch of bad stuff happens in San Francisco and it’s just failure after failure after failure. Instead of come to terms with this, he tries to write a story. A sarcastic play called welcome to Sanford psycho, but the story doesn’t go according to plan and Galvin finds himself on a plane leaving the country of his birth and that’s the that represents escape and gravity. And then the universe opens up to him and he becomes rich and successful and has the wherewithal to direct that energy outward to helping others
