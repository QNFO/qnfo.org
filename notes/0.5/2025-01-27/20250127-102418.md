Here’s how you could frame the argument to your marketing and sales contact at NanaWall:
1. Highlight the Benefits of Large Window Walls in Public Housing:
 - Improved Natural Light and Ventilation: Emphasize how NanaWall systems can transform public housing spaces with abundant natural light and fresh air. This can lead to healthier living environments, reduced energy costs (less reliance on artificial lighting and HVAC), and improved mood and well-being for residents.
 - Connection to the Outdoors: Stress the biophilic design aspect. NanaWall systems can create a stronger connection to nature, even in dense urban environments. This can be especially valuable in public housing where access to green spaces might be limited.
 - Enhanced Aesthetics: Don’t just focus on “looking good from the outside.” Explain how expansive glass walls can make interiors feel larger, more modern, and more inviting.
 - Flexibility and Space Optimization: NanaWall’s opening glass walls can help create flexible, multi-functional spaces. This is crucial in potentially smaller public housing units where space needs to be used efficiently.
2. Address the Cost Concerns:
 - Long-Term Value and ROI: Acknowledge that NanaWall systems may have a higher upfront cost than traditional windows. However, emphasize the long-term cost savings through reduced energy consumption and potentially lower maintenance.
 - Competitive Pricing Strategy: Suggest exploring options for more cost-effective NanaWall configurations specifically for large-scale projects like public housing. This could involve:
   - Standardized designs to streamline production
   - Value-engineered systems with slightly reduced features while maintaining core functionality
   - Negotiated bulk discounts for large orders
 - LEED and Sustainability: Play up the potential for NanaWall systems to contribute to LEED certification and other sustainability goals, which can be a major selling point for public housing projects.
3. The Sliding Door Analogy:
You’re right! Sliding glass doors were once ubiquitous but have fallen out of favor. This could be because:
 - Limited design options: Older sliding doors often looked dated and bulky.
 - Poor performance: They were often drafty and offered limited insulation.
NanaWall systems address these issues with:
 - Sleek, modern designs: They offer a wide range of styles and configurations to complement any architectural style.
 - High performance: Advanced engineering ensures superior thermal efficiency, weather resistance, and soundproofing.
In Conclusion:
By focusing on the long-term benefits, cost-effectiveness strategies, and the potential for creating healthier, more beautiful living spaces, you can make a compelling case for NanaWall in the public housing market.
