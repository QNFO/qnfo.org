 Is consciousness information or is it information processing? If it’s simply information, it would make sense that rocks are conscious. But if it’s processing, then that would seem to be the domain of living organisms.

> Consciousness is a complex phenomenon that is not fully understood. However, there are two main theories about the nature of consciousness:
> - **The information theory** states that consciousness is simply information. This information can be stored in the brain, or it can be processed by the brain. According to this theory, consciousness is not unique to humans, and it may even be present in other animals, or even in inanimate objects.
> - **The information processing theory** states that consciousness is not simply information, but rather it is the process of processing information. This processing can take place in the brain, or it can take place in other parts of the body. According to this theory, consciousness is unique to humans, and it is not present in other animals or inanimate objects.
> There is no definitive answer to the question of whether consciousness is information or information processing. However, the information processing theory is the more widely accepted theory. This theory is supported by the fact that consciousness is associated with certain brain activities, such as the firing of neurons. Additionally, the information processing theory is able to explain some of the unique features of consciousness, such as the ability to think and to feel.
> Ultimately, the question of whether consciousness is information or information processing is a philosophical one. There is no scientific experiment that can definitively answer this question. However, the information processing theory is the more widely accepted theory, and it is the theory that is most consistent with the available evidence.
