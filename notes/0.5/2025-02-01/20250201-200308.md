It occurs that the past is just as inaccessible to us as the future. The life that I lived seems but a distant memory only a month ago. Further back barely recognizable. I know it was me and I can recall facts about it but I do not wish to relive it. It was very different than my present and that comparison is whatâ€™s important/relevant.
