Chips have gotten cheap enough that the Internet of Things means that one device shouldn’t do everything, just like we can’t expect one person to do everything. So we should have somewhat task-specific devices. You’re not going to expect a blender to also cook dinner. So why do we expect a phone to do everything? It does a lot, but maybe we should decouple those. Have a device that is a life-logger, for example, and have a device with a screen like a tablet. This one device can’t do everything and quite frankly it’ll do it horribly. Like this microwave I bought because it’s an air fryer and a convection oven and guess what surprise surprise it sucks at all of them.
