You’re absolutely right! Focusing solely on “service animal” can sometimes limit your search.
Here’s an updated list of search terms, incorporating your preferences for light and views:
Refined Search Terms:
 - “Sunset District 2BR apartment light-filled views”
 - “Western Addition 2BR apartment panoramic views”
 - “Inner Sunset 2BR apartment large windows city views”
 - “Outer Sunset 2BR apartment sunny spacious”
 - “2BR apartments near Golden Gate Park stunning views”
 - “Light-filled 2BR apartments San Francisco”
Key Considerations:
 - “Light-filled” & “Sunny”: These terms will help you find apartments with ample natural light, which is crucial.
 - “Views”:
   - City Views: Common and often spectacular.
   - Park Views: Golden Gate Park, Twin Peaks, etc.
   - Water Views: Bay, Ocean (if possible).
   - “Panoramic Views” or “Views” alone can be broad but effective.
 - “Spacious” or “Large Windows”: These terms can help you find units with good natural light and a sense of openness.
 - Building Features: Continue to consider elevators, laundry, and secure entry.
Remember:
 - Landlords are legally obligated to accommodate service animals. You can address this directly when contacting potential landlords/property managers.
 - Be prepared to be flexible. Your ideal apartment might not have every single thing on your wish list. Prioritize your must-haves (light, outdoor space, location) and be open to compromises on others (specific views).
I hope this refined approach helps you find the perfect apartment in San Francisco!
