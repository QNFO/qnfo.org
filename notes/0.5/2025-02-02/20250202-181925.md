Create a comprehensive financial plan for a tech entrepreneur and AI expert from age 43 until the end of their natural life, focusing on maximizing financial sustainability. The individual has approximately $100,000 in liquid cash assets in a money market account and $200,000 in a 2045 Target Date retirement fund with negligible fees.

Key Considerations:

1. Financial Strategy & Retirement Timeline

The individual will have zero additional income or savings contributions until Social Security kicks in at the earliest possible date that extends financial sustainability.

The plan should outline an optimal withdrawal strategy to make current assets last as long as possible while accounting for Social Security benefits.

2. Global Living Scenarios & Rationale
The individual is considering relocating to the following locations, chosen for their affordability, tech ecosystem, and financial advantages:

Thailand (Bangkok or Chiang Mai): A low-cost destination with a growing AI and startup scene, making it attractive for an entrepreneur with a tech background.

Taiwan (Taipei): A major hub for AI research, semiconductor innovation, and strong government support for tech development.

Portugal (Lisbon): Offers tax incentives for expatriates, access to the European market, and a developing digital business ecosystem.

Estonia (Tallinn): A highly digitized economy with low business taxes, the e-Residency program, and a cost-effective EU base for entrepreneurs.

3. Financial Planning & Longevity Projections

Estimate how long current savings will last in each location, factoring in living expenses, healthcare, and visa-related costs.

Project investment growth based on a balanced allocation in a 2045 Target Date fund.

Identify the earliest Social Security claiming age that maximizes financial sustainability.

Outline an optimal withdrawal strategy to balance liquid cash usage and retirement account distributions.

4. Risk Management & Contingency Planning

Include strategies to mitigate healthcare inflation, currency fluctuations, and market downturns.

Recommend an emergency fund strategy to address unexpected expenses.

Assess the feasibility of long-term residency in each location based on visa rules and cost trends.

Generate a financial projection comparing outcomes for each location and recommend the most sustainable strategy to ensure financial stability throughout the individualâ€™s lifetime.
