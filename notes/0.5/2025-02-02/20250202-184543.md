Okay, here is a comprehensive financial plan based on the revised prompt, designed for a 43-year-old tech entrepreneur seeking a perpetual traveler lifestyle. This plan incorporates location-specific budgeting, healthcare considerations, risk management, and emphasizes adaptability.
Financial Plan: Perpetual Traveler
Executive Summary:
This plan outlines a strategy for a 43-year-old, healthy, single tech entrepreneur to achieve a sustainable “perpetual traveler” lifestyle until the estimated age of 95. It prioritizes exploring Asia, Europe (with a focus on Estonia and Eastern Europe), and South America, utilizing visa-free entries and short-stay visas. The plan incorporates detailed location-specific budgets, a serviced apartment accommodation strategy, healthcare considerations, and risk mitigation strategies. Recognizing the inherent uncertainties of this lifestyle, the plan emphasizes adaptability and regular reviews.
Assumptions:
 - No Additional Income: The individual will rely solely on existing assets and Social Security.
 - Starting Assets: $100,000 (liquid cash) + $200,000 (2045 Target Date Fund).
 - Investment Return: 4% average annual real return (after inflation) on the Target Date Fund.
 - Inflation: 2% average annual inflation, with adjustments for specific locations when data is available.
 - Healthcare: Access to national healthcare systems or lower-cost healthcare in many countries, supplemented by comprehensive travel medical insurance.
 - Social Security: Optimal claiming age to be determined. Projected annual benefit at 67 is $24,000, and at 62 is $19,200.
 - Life Expectancy: 95 years.
I. Financial Strategy & Retirement Timeline:
 - Withdrawal Strategy:
   - Utilize the $100,000 liquid assets first.
   - Begin conservative withdrawals from the Target Date Fund after depleting liquid assets, adjusting the rate based on location-specific budgets and market performance.
   - Claim Social Security at the optimal age determined below.
 - Social Security Claiming Age:
   - Analysis: Delaying Social Security until age 67 maximizes monthly benefits. While claiming at 62 provides immediate income, the reduced benefits may compromise long-term sustainability, given the individual’s current health and desire for a long retirement.
   - Recommendation: Claim Social Security at age 67.
II. Perpetual Traveler Lifestyle & Itinerary:
 - Visa Strategy: Utilize visa-free entries and short-stay tourist visas (30-90 days), primarily.
 - Accommodation: 2-3 days in a hotel upon arrival, then transition to serviced apartments for stays of 30 days or longer.
