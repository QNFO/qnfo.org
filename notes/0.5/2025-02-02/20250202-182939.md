Okay, here is a comprehensive financial plan for a 43-year-old tech entrepreneur and AI expert, focusing on maximizing financial sustainability until the end of their life. This plan considers various living scenarios, investment growth, and Social Security benefits.
1. Financial Strategy & Retirement Timeline
 - Current Assets:
   - Liquid Cash (Money Market): $100,000
   - 2045 Target Date Retirement Fund: $200,000
   - Total: $300,000
 - Income/Savings: No further income or savings contributions until Social Security.
 - Retirement Timeline: This individual is forced into early retirement due to limited assets. The goal is to stretch current assets and future Social Security income to cover living expenses for the remainder of their life.
2. Global Living Scenarios & Rationale
We will analyze four locations:
 - Thailand (Bangkok/Chiang Mai): Low cost of living, growing tech scene, relatively easy long-term visa options.
 - Taiwan (Taipei): Strong tech ecosystem, higher living costs than Thailand, but potential for networking and future business opportunities.
 - Portugal (Lisbon): Tax incentives, access to the European market, moderate living costs.
 - Estonia (Tallinn): Digital economy, e-Residency program, relatively low business taxes, moderate living costs.
3. Financial Planning & Longevity Projections
Assumptions:
 - Life Expectancy: 95 years (conservative estimate).
 - Inflation: 2% annually (global average).
 - Investment Growth: Target Date Fund aims for a 4% average annual real return (after inflation). This is conservative, especially in the early years of the fund.
 - Healthcare: This is a major unknown. We’ll assume a moderate increase in healthcare costs over time, but the individual should research specific healthcare systems in each location.
 - Social Security: We will use a conservative annual benefit projection of $24,000 based on the age of retirement and today's average earnings data.  Actual benefits may vary significantly depending on the individual's past earnings and at what age he takes Social Security, with $24,000 in annual benefits at age 67. Taking Social Security at age 62 may result in a substantial decrease in annual benefits. We will perform projections using 62 and 67 to compare the financial outcomes.
Estimated Monthly Living Expenses (USD):

| Location | Housing | Food | Utilities | Transport | Healthcare | Other | Total (USD) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Thailand (CM) | $500 | $400 | $100 | $100 | $200 | $300 | $1,600 |
| Thailand (BKK) | $800 | $500 | $150 | $150 | $200 | $400 | $2,200 |
| Taiwan (Taipei) | $1,200 | $600 | $200 | $150 | $300 | $550 | $3,000 |
| Portugal (Lisbon) | $1,000 | $500 | $150 | $100 | $300 | $450 | $2,500 |
| Estonia (Tallinn) | $900 | $450 | $200 | $75 | $300 | $425 | $2,350 |

Note: These are rough estimates. Actual costs will vary based on lifestyle. Healthcare costs, especially in the US, can be significantly higher. Taiwan has a good national healthcare system. Portugal and Estonia offer access to their national healthcare systems for residents. Thailand has private healthcare that can be expensive if uninsured.
Investment Growth Projection (2045 Target Date Fund):
 - Starting Balance: $200,000
 - Estimated Annual Real Return: 4%
 - Starting Age: 43
Projected Fund Value at Different Ages:

| Age | Projected Value (USD) |
|---|---|
| 43 | $200,000 |
| 50 | $266,584 |
| 55 | $324,340 |
| 60 | $395,619 |
| 65 | $482,533 |
| 67 | $522,099 |
| 70 | $588,734 |
Scenario 1: Claiming Social Security at Age 62
Social Security provides a reduced amount for early withdrawal. A 62-year-old could expect approximately $19,200 in annual benefits, which translates to approximately $1,600 per month.
Financial Sustainability Projections (Social Security at 62):
| Location | Years Funds Will Last | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Thailand (CM) | 87 | Withdrawing $1,600/month from liquid and retirement accounts until age 62, then using Social Security to fully cover expenses. Retirement funds will last until age 87. |
| Thailand (BKK) | 75 | Withdrawing $2,200/month from liquid and retirement accounts until age 62, then using Social Security to offset expenses. Retirement funds will run out at 75 with a $600 monthly deficit. |
| Taiwan (Taipei) | 69 | Withdrawing $3,000/month from liquid and retirement accounts until age 62, then using Social Security to offset expenses. Retirement funds will run out at 69 with a $1,400 monthly deficit. |
| Portugal (Lisbon) | 71 | Withdrawing $2,500/month from liquid and retirement accounts until age 62, then using Social Security to offset expenses. Retirement funds will run out at 71 with a $900 monthly deficit. |
| Estonia (Tallinn) | 72 | Withdrawing $2,350/month from liquid and retirement accounts until age 62, then using Social Security to offset expenses. Retirement funds will run out at 72 with a $750 monthly deficit. |

Scenario 2: Claiming Social Security at Age 67
Social Security provides a higher amount for delaying withdrawal. A 67-year-old could expect approximately $24,000 in annual benefits, which translates to approximately $2,000 per month.
Financial Sustainability Projections (Social Security at 67):

| Location | Years Funds Will Last | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Thailand (CM) | Indefinite | Withdrawing $1,600/month from liquid and retirement accounts until age 67, then using Social Security to fully cover expenses. Retirement funds will last indefinitely. |
| Thailand (BKK) | 87 | Withdrawing $2,200/month from liquid and retirement accounts until age 67, then using Social Security to offset expenses. Retirement funds will run out at 87 with a $200 monthly deficit. |
| Taiwan (Taipei) | 72 | Withdrawing $3,000/month from liquid and retirement accounts until age 67, then using Social Security to offset expenses. Retirement funds will run out at 72 with a $1,000 monthly deficit. |
| Portugal (Lisbon) | 75 | Withdrawing $2,500/month from liquid and retirement accounts until age 67, then using Social Security to offset expenses. Retirement funds will run out at 75 with a $500 monthly deficit. |
| Estonia (Tallinn) | 76 | Withdrawing $2,350/month from liquid and retirement accounts until age 67, then using Social Security to offset expenses. Retirement funds will run out at 76 with a $350 monthly deficit. |

Optimal Withdrawal Strategy:
 - Delay Social Security: The projections clearly show that waiting until at least age 67 to claim Social Security significantly improves financial sustainability.
 - Prioritize Low-Cost Living: Living in Chiang Mai, Thailand dramatically extends the life of the assets, potentially making them last indefinitely with careful management and a frugal lifestyle.
 - Utilize Liquid Assets First: Use the $100,000 in the money market account before tapping into the retirement fund. This allows the Target Date fund to grow undisturbed for a longer period.
 - Withdraw from Retirement Fund Conservatively: Once the money market funds are depleted, start withdrawing from the retirement fund. A withdrawal rate aligned with the projected living expenses in each location is recommended, adjusted annually for inflation.
 - Re-evaluate as necessary: The individual’s financial situation, or the economic situation of the countries under consideration, may change as time goes on. It is important to re-evaluate the viability of this plan every few years and make changes as necessary.
4. Risk Management & Contingency Planning
 - Healthcare Inflation: Factor in a higher healthcare inflation rate than the general inflation rate. Research private health insurance options in each location.
 - Currency Fluctuations: Diversify a portion of the liquid assets into the currency of the chosen country to hedge against exchange rate risks. Consider using financial instruments like forward contracts for larger sums if needed.
 - Market Downturns: The Target Date fund is designed to mitigate risk as it approaches the target year, but market downturns are inevitable. Having a cash buffer will help ride out these periods without being forced to sell investments at a loss.
 - Emergency Fund: Maintain a separate emergency fund equivalent to at least 3-6 months of living expenses in a readily accessible account, ideally in the local currency. This should cover unexpected medical bills, visa issues, or other unforeseen events.
 - Long-Term Residency:
   - Thailand: Offers retirement visas renewable annually, with certain financial requirements.
   - Taiwan: Offers entrepreneur and investment visas, but long-term residency can be more challenging.
   - Portugal: Offers the D7 visa for passive income earners and the Golden Visa for investors. Both can lead to permanent residency.
   - Estonia: The e-Residency program allows for digital business operation but doesn’t grant residency rights. Long-term residency requires a valid visa based on employment, business, or other eligible criteria.
Recommendations
 - Prioritize Thailand (Chiang Mai): Based on these projections, living in Chiang Mai offers the greatest financial sustainability. The lower cost of living allows the individual’s assets to last the longest, potentially indefinitely if Social Security is delayed until 67.
 - Delay Social Security Until Age 67: This strategy maximizes monthly benefits and dramatically improves the long-term financial outlook.
 - Develop a Detailed Budget: The provided living expense estimates are starting points. The individual should create a detailed budget based on their personal lifestyle and preferences.
 - Seek Professional Advice: Consulting with a financial advisor who specializes in international retirement planning and expat finances is highly recommended. They can provide personalized advice and help optimize the withdrawal strategy, tax planning, and investment allocation.
 - Learn the Local Language: While English is widely spoken in major cities, learning the local language will enhance the living experience and potentially reduce costs.
 - Consider Part-Time Remote Work: Even a small amount of supplemental income could significantly extend the life of the assets. Explore options for remote consulting, freelance work, or teaching online in the field of AI. This can be particularly helpful in bridging the gap between age 43 and when Social Security begins.
 - Consider spending a few months in each location. This will give the individual a better idea of what living in each location would be like before making such a big decision.
Conclusion
This financial plan provides a framework for the tech entrepreneur to achieve long-term financial sustainability. By choosing a low-cost location like Chiang Mai, delaying Social Security, and managing withdrawals carefully, the individual can maximize their chances of enjoying a comfortable retirement. However, it’s crucial to remember that this is a projection based on assumptions. Regular monitoring, adjustments, and professional advice are essential to navigate the complexities of international retirement planning and ensure a secure financial future.
