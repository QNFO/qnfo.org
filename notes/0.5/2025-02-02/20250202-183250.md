Okay, I understand. Let’s revamp the perpetual traveler plan to prioritize Asia first, followed by Europe (with a focus on Estonia and Eastern Europe), and then South America, while avoiding North America for at least the first two years.
Revised Rotation Plan (Asia, Europe, South America):
This plan prioritizes Asia for the first year, moves to Europe with an emphasis on Estonia and Eastern Europe in the second year, and then heads to South America in the third year.
Year 1: Asia Focus
 - Thailand (Chiang Mai): 60 days (30-day visa exemption + 30-day extension) - Establish a base, explore northern Thailand.
 - Vietnam: 30 days - Explore the country, from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City.
 - Malaysia: 60 days - Explore Kuala Lumpur, Penang, and other areas.
 - Indonesia (Bali): 60 days (30-day visa-free + extension) - Relax, enjoy the beaches, consider a yoga retreat.
 - Philippines: 30 days - Island hopping, explore the natural beauty.
 - Thailand (Southern Islands): 30 days - Relax on the beaches, go diving or snorkeling.
Year 2: Europe - Estonia & Eastern Europe
 - Georgia: 90 days - Explore Tbilisi, the Caucasus Mountains, enjoy the food and wine. A good base for exploring the region.
 - Estonia (Tallinn): 90 days (Schengen) - Immerse yourself in the tech scene, explore the e-Residency program, enjoy the medieval city.
 - Latvia (Riga): 30 days (Schengen) Explore another Baltic capital, known for its Art Nouveau architecture.
 - Lithuania (Vilnius): 30 days (Schengen) Discover the charming Old Town, a UNESCO World Heritage site.
 - Poland (Krakow/Warsaw): 30 days (Schengen) - Explore historical cities, experience Polish culture.
 - Albania: 90 days - Explore the Albanian Riviera, historical sites, and enjoy the low cost of living
Year 3: South America
 - Colombia: 90 days - Explore Medellin, the Coffee Region, and the Caribbean coast.
 - Ecuador: 90 days - Visit the Galapagos Islands (consider a shorter, budget-friendly tour), explore the Andes, experience the Amazon rainforest.
 - Peru: 90 days - Hike the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu (book well in advance), explore Lima, visit Lake Titicaca.
 - Bolivia: 90 days - Salt Flats of Uyuni and the high-altitude capital of La Paz.
Year 4 Onwards:
 - Continue rotating among your favorite locations in Asia, Europe (including other Schengen countries for short stays), and South America.
 - Consider adding new destinations based on your interests and visa options, such as:
   - Asia: South Korea, Japan (more expensive, but culturally rich).
   - Europe: Croatia, Bulgaria, Romania (non-Schengen, but relatively easy visa access).
   - South America: Chile, Argentina, Brazil (larger countries that require more time to explore).
Important Considerations:
 - Schengen Area: Remember the 90/180-day rule. Time spent in any Schengen country, including Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland counts toward the 90-day limit within any 180-day period. You’ll need to strategically plan your time in and out of the Schengen zone to avoid overstaying. You may find it helpful to alternate between Estonia and countries like Georgia and Albania which are not part of the Schengen Area.
 - Visa Requirements: Double-check visa requirements for each country well in advance of your travel dates. Regulations can change.
 - Onward Travel: Be prepared to show proof of onward travel when entering some countries.
 - Financial Resources: Have bank statements readily available to demonstrate you can support yourself.
 - Travel Insurance: Absolutely essential. Ensure your policy covers all the countries you plan to visit and includes medical emergencies, repatriation, and trip interruptions.
Financial Adjustments & Recommendations:
 - Budget: An average of $2,000-$2,500 per month is a reasonable estimate, but this will vary depending on your specific destinations and lifestyle. You could likely manage on less in Southeast Asia and parts of Eastern Europe, while Western Europe and some South American destinations might be more expensive.
 - Accommodation: Mix budget-friendly options like hostels, guesthouses, and Airbnbs to keep costs down.
 - Food: Embrace local cuisine, street food, and markets. Cooking some of your own meals will also save money.
 - Transportation: Utilize budget airlines, buses, and trains whenever possible.
 - Asset Longevity: With careful budgeting and by prioritizing lower-cost destinations, you can maximize the lifespan of your assets. Delaying Social Security until 67 remains the optimal strategy.
 - Withdrawal Strategy:
   - Use your $100,000 in liquid assets first.
   - Start withdrawing from your Target Date retirement fund as needed, aiming for a conservative withdrawal rate (e.g., 4-5% annually, adjusted for inflation) to preserve your principal for as long as possible.
   - Maintain an emergency fund of $5,000-$10,000 in a readily accessible account.
 - Seek Professional Advice: Consult with a financial advisor experienced in international retirement and a travel expert familiar with long-term, multi-country travel.
Conclusion:
This revised plan provides a roadmap for your perpetual travel adventure, starting with Asia, moving to Europe (with a focus on Estonia and Eastern Europe), and then exploring South America. By embracing a flexible itinerary, managing your finances wisely, and prioritizing lower-cost destinations, you can enjoy a fulfilling and sustainable lifestyle while exploring the world. Remember to stay informed about visa regulations, prioritize your safety and well-being, and adjust your plans as needed. Most importantly, have an incredible journey!
