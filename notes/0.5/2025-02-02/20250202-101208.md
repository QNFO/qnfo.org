# **LLM Showdown: Blind Ensemble Round Robin**

**Intellectual Property Edition**

## Objective

Evaluate how well different LLMs interpret ambiguous or incomplete queries by inferring latent intent, particularly for users with limited familiarity in crafting detailed prompts, such as those accustomed to casual text messages or basic search queries, and assess their ability to provide clear, actionable, and accurate responses tailored to the user’s assumed profile and use case.

## Prompt

Use the same prompt for all LLMs:

>I got a provisional patent for my invention and want to protect it internationally on my own can you give me simple steps to do this without needing a lawyer

This prompt is intentionally vague to test the LLM’s ability to infer context and provide useful guidance.

## Select LLMs

Choose a diverse set of LLMs for comparison.

*Note: Anthropic Claude is excluded due to its extraordinary requirement for a “valid” mobile number and confirmation that a user is over 18 years of age.

## Control Variables

- **Environment:** Test all models from their web interface on Chrome browser in incognito mode.
- **No Login or Identification:** Where possible, avoid logging in or providing identifying information to ensure anonymity and eliminate bias.
- **Default Settings:** Use default configurations for model selection, extensions, temperature, and other parameters without customization.

## Evaluate Responses

The list of responses are then copied verbatim as shown into new chat threads, preceded by the prompt. Scoring is determined by each LLM evaluator based on its interpretation of the criteria:

## Responses

### Response A

> Congratulations on getting a provisional patent! That’s a huge accomplishment. Protecting your invention internationally is a smart move. While navigating the international patent system can be complex, here are some general steps you can take to explore this process on your own. Keep in mind that consulting with a patent attorney is always recommended for comprehensive legal guidance, as patent law can be intricate.
>
> **1. Understand the Basics of International Patent Protection:**
>
> - **Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT):** The PCT is a treaty with over 150 member countries. Filing a PCT application doesn’t grant a patent, but it simplifies the process by allowing you to file one application that has the same effect as filing separate applications in each country where you seek protection. It also gives you 30 months (sometimes more) from the earliest filing date to decide which countries you want to pursue patents in.
> - **Paris Convention:** This convention provides a “right of priority.” If you file a patent application in one member country, you can use that filing date as the effective filing date for applications in other member countries, as long as you file those applications within 12 months of the original filing. This is important for establishing priority over other inventions.
>
> **2. Decide Where You Want Protection:**
>
> - Consider where your target markets are. Which countries are most important for your invention’s commercial success? This will determine where you need to seek patent protection.
>
> **3. File a PCT Application (or directly in specific countries):**
>
> - **PCT Route:** You can file a PCT application with your national patent office or directly with the International Bureau of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). This application will include a description of your invention, drawings (if necessary), and your claims.
> - **Direct Route:** Alternatively, you can file patent applications directly in the patent offices of the countries where you seek protection. This might be more complex and expensive upfront, but could be faster in some cases.
>
> **4. National Phase:**
>
> - After the PCT application is published (usually 18 months from the earliest filing date), you’ll enter the “national phase.” This is where you must file separate patent applications in the national patent offices of the countries where you want to get a patent.
> - You’ll need to translate your application into the official language of each country’s patent office.
>
> **5. Examination and Grant:**
>
> - Each national patent office will examine your application to determine if your invention is new, inventive (non-obvious), and industrially applicable.
> - If your application meets these requirements, the patent will be granted.
>
> **Important Considerations:**
>
> - **Costs:** International patent protection can be expensive. There are filing fees, translation costs, and potentially attorney fees if you decide to seek professional help later in the process.
> - **Deadlines:** There are strict deadlines at each stage of the process. Missing a deadline can result in the loss of your patent rights.
> - **Language:** As mentioned above, you’ll likely need to translate your application into multiple languages.
>
> **Resources:**
>
> - **WIPO:** The World Intellectual Property Organization website (wipo.int) is an excellent resource for information on international patents. They offer guides, tutorials, and databases that can be very helpful.
>
> Remember, this is a general overview. Patent law is complex, and the specific requirements can vary from country to country. While it’s possible to navigate the process yourself, consulting with a qualified patent attorney is highly recommended to ensure you have the best possible protection for your invention. They can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation and help you avoid costly mistakes.

### Response B

> Congrats on getting your provisional patent! If you want to protect your invention internationally without hiring a lawyer, here are the general steps you can follow:
>
> ### 1. **File a PCT Application (Patent Cooperation Treaty)**
>
> - **What is it?** The PCT allows you to seek patent protection in multiple countries with one application.
> - **How to do it:**
>     - You need to file an international application through the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). This will give you protection in multiple countries, with one centralized filing.
>     - You can file the PCT application within **12 months** of your provisional patent filing (this is your priority date).
>     - The PCT application does not grant a patent, but it gives you a **global priority date** and a **search report** that helps determine the likelihood of your invention being granted a patent.
>
> ### 2. **Choose Countries for Protection**
>
> - **What is it?** You can select which countries or regions you want to file for protection. This decision is based on where you plan to commercialize your product.
> - **How to do it:**
>     - PCT gives you **18 months** from your initial filing to choose which countries you want to apply in. Each country has its own rules, fees, and timelines.
>     - You can file in regional patent systems (like the European Patent Office or the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization) if you want multiple countries within a region.
>
> ### 3. **National Phase Entry**
>
> - **What is it?** After filing the PCT application, you’ll need to enter the **national phase** in each country where you want patent protection.
> - **How to do it:**
>     - This involves filing additional documents and paying fees in each chosen country.
>     - You’ll generally have **30-31 months** from your priority date to enter the national phase in each country. Each country will conduct its own examination process.
>
> ### 4. **Track Deadlines & Keep Everything Updated**
>
> - **What is it?** Stay on top of deadlines to maintain your rights.
> - **How to do it:**
>     - Keep track of the deadlines for national phase entries, fees, and responses. Some countries allow you to file online or use their respective patent office portals.
>
> ### 5. **Consider Filing in Specific Countries Directly (if needed)**
>
> - If you don’t want to go through the PCT process for specific countries, you can file directly with the respective national patent offices (e.g., USPTO for the U.S., EPO for Europe).
>
> ### 6. **Maintain the Patents**
>
> - After you’ve received patents, you’ll need to **pay maintenance fees** periodically to keep them active in each country.
>
> ### Tools to Help:
>
> - **WIPO’s PCT Online Filing**: You can file your PCT application online.
> - **USPTO’s Global Dossier**: This can help track your PCT application and national filings.
>
> ### A Few Things to Keep in Mind:
>
> - Filing internationally can get expensive, especially as you enter national phases.
> - The patent offices might not communicate directly with each other, so you need to handle filings separately.
>
> This is a simplified overview. While you don’t need a lawyer, you’ll want to make sure you follow all rules carefully. There are online services and guides available to help you with specific patent office filings.

### Response C

> Securing international patent protection on your own is possible, but it requires careful planning and adherence to the rules of each country or region where you seek protection. Here’s a simplified step-by-step guide to help you navigate the process:
