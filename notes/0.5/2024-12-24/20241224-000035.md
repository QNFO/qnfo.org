On the night I received my ticket, I recall approaching the intersection and applying the grade, so 8 o’clock at night. I have a witness who was a passenger riding with me. Although adjacent to a recreation area, there were no other cars approaching the intersection at the time, and the police vehicle that pulled me over was not visible, I do recall that there were no other people in the vicinity as I checked the intersection before entering it, although there is no stop bar at the intersection. The officer apologized multiple times and indicated that this was some kind of targeted enforcement Due to pedestrian and children hazards, although none were present at the time, and it was unclear what the relationship was between the targeted enforcement effort and the reason for my stop.

It’s also possible that the officer mistook reflectors in the upper part of my moped for Indicator lights and failed to see the actual indicators. Driving a moped and driving an actual motor vehicle are significantly different, including stopping distance and Line of sight. So it’s much easier to see and scan an intersection while approaching it.

I also submit as evidence an email exchange with my incoming city supervisor acknowledging that the ticket seems unwarranted given the facts and circumstances. And that There is more than reasonable doubt that the allegations of the ticket are contradicted by the facts and circumstances.

Draft a convincing narrative based on these facts to fight my moving violation ticket for failing to stop at a stop sign.

> To the Honorable Court,
> I am writing to contest the moving violation I received for allegedly failing to stop at a stop sign on [Date of Ticket] at approximately 8:00 PM. I believe this ticket was issued in error, and the facts and circumstances clearly demonstrate that I took due care and caution when approaching and entering the intersection in question.
> On the night in question, I approached the intersection at [Intersection Name/Location]. While this intersection is adjacent to a recreational area, it was deserted at the time. There were no pedestrians, children, or other vehicles present. I carefully scanned the intersection before proceeding, ensuring it was safe to enter. It is important to note that this intersection lacks a stop bar, which can sometimes create ambiguity regarding the precise stopping point.
> I was operating a moped, not a standard motor vehicle. This distinction is crucial because a moped offers a significantly different driving experience, including a lower profile and unobstructed line of sight. This allows for a more comprehensive view of the intersection while approaching. I was able to clearly assess the absence of any cross-traffic or pedestrians before proceeding.
> The officer who issued the citation apologized repeatedly, stating that the stop was part of a targeted enforcement effort due to pedestrian and child hazards. However, as previously stated, no pedestrians or children were present at the time. The connection between the targeted enforcement and the reason for my stop remained unclear, further adding to the confusion surrounding this incident.
> It is also possible that the officer misidentified reflectors located on the upper portion of my moped as activated turn signals. My actual turn signals, which were functioning correctly, may have been obscured from the officer’s vantage point.
> I have a corroborating witness who was a passenger on my moped at the time, who can attest to the fact that I approached the intersection cautiously and that it was clear of any traffic or pedestrians.
> Furthermore, I am submitting as evidence an email exchange with my incoming city supervisor, [Supervisor’s Name/Title], who concurs that there is more than reasonable doubt regarding the validity of the allegations. This communication underscores the questionable nature of this citation.
> Given the absence of any hazard, the clear visibility at the time, the lack of any other vehicles or pedestrians, the potential for misidentification of my moped’s lighting, and the corroborating testimony of my passenger, I respectfully request that this court dismiss the citation. I believe the evidence clearly demonstrates that I acted responsibly and did not violate any traffic laws. Thank you for your time and consideration.
