There are two signs. There’s a sign on the wall at my therapist’s office that says, everyone is welcome, important, respected, encouraged, loved, valued, celebrated here. Those are nice words, but are they put into practice? Because that’s not been my experience.

Likewise, the TV is showing one of those hopelessly cheery fireplace Christmas scenes with snow and lights. And wouldn’t it be nice if that were reality?
