Marketing and salespeople have taken over the United States where the mantra is, sell, sell, sell and this is permeated into other parts of the world too. The product itself and how it improves someoneâ€™s life or makes something better or even the quality of that no longer seem to matter as long as it sells more.

But simply selling more is dead weight. That produces an economic transaction that now needs administrative and accounting and accounts payable and customer success and all of this overhead that would otherwise not exist. Certainly not for repeat sales and those marketers should put themselves out of a job if they were good.
