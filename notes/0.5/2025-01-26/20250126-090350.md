I’d argue that even hallucinated information from a well-meaning non-malicious not identifiably biased AI language model is still better than ignorance and time has its cost there’s a case study and traveling to a foreign city and arrive late at night and I don’t have an accommodation book but I want to be open to options that might let me meet people rather than hold myself up in solitary in a hotel room I’m getting some great iterative feedback from Google Gemini and have even used it to take photos of street maps here in Seoul that it can then tell me where to go to find coffee on a Sunday morning when nobody’s up in the shops are mostly closed as I’m sipping my warm cup of Joe thanking AI. Even when T-Mobile is failing miserably I didn’t think I needed to call them in advance to get roaming service when that’s why I went with them in the first place.
