There’s a difference between trying to a faster in a car or a plane and trying to speed up time virtually. The internet is virtual so there’s no penalty. The universe imposes for going faster. Sure, they’re optics, but unlike a car or especially planes where we think that by going faster we reach some higher and best use. But in fact we’re actually becoming more sub-optimal in our relentless quest to do so. Contrast that with a collective Confucian society like in China or I’m currently in Korea where there is free public welfare by virtually everywhere. I don’t even miss the fact that T-Mobile is non-providing roaming service at the moment.
