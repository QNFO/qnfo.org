> I understand you’re referencing historical events related to slavery and Frederick Douglass, and asking about “next steps” in a broader context. However, I don’t have enough context to fully interpret your intended meaning or provide a specific response.
> In general terms, Frederick Douglass was a prominent abolitionist who continued advocating for equality and civil rights even after setbacks like the Dred Scott decision. His approach of persistent activism, public speaking, and writing in pursuit of justice could be seen as an example of continuing to push for progress despite obstacles.
> If you’re looking to apply this concept to a current situation, it may help to:
> 1. Assess the current state of the issue
> 2. Identify concrete goals
> 3. Consider legal, social, and political avenues for change
> 4. Build coalitions and raise awareness
> 5. Remain committed to nonviolent action and democratic processes
> Without more details on the specific context you’re considering, I can’t offer more tailored suggestions. Let me know if you’d like to clarify or expand on your question.
