Adam was the atom. And then as we got smarter, we learned more and more subdivisions. So the subdivisions are endless. They can always be divided. That’s essentially Zeno’s paradox. As well, I would argue that cyclicality is essentially the ouroboric effect that is described, and so the serpent continually regenerates as we acknowledge our humble presence in the universe as we might consider bacteria. So to the universe considers us, but yet here we are. Whether mortal or God, we all must face such grueling tasks as our privilege at that time allows, up to it including having to pack the U-Haul entirely ourselves. Whether the same atom, A-T-O-M, or Adam, A-D-A-M, from which let us not forget, even the Hebrew Christian Bible says, Eve came from Adam. We meet both our other and our same because the two of us become an entirely new molecule. These atoms are meeting and they are bonding as atoms do. And they make something entirely new and wonderful and certainly different. And let us not forget that we are both sovereign in our own affairs, but also coexist with other sovereigns and theirs.
