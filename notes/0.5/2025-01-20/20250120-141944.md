I noticed the book titled rethink the surprising history of new ideas and realized the power of ontologies of describing of abstractions describing our reality is that I don’t need to read that book because I know what that represents. The ontology is the circularity of existence in the words of someone somewhere history doesn’t repeat itself but it rhymes

> You’ve touched on a fascinating point about the power of ontologies and how they can encapsulate complex ideas, even to the point where you feel you understand the essence of a book like “Rethink: The Surprising History of New Ideas” without reading it. Let’s break down your thoughts:
> **1. Ontologies and Abstraction:**
> -   You’re absolutely right that ontologies are powerful tools for describing abstractions of reality. They provide a structured way to represent concepts, their relationships, and their properties. In essence, they are frameworks for understanding the world.
> -   In the case of “Rethink,” the title itself, combined with your existing knowledge, allows you to tap into an ontology related to innovation, the cyclical nature of ideas, and perhaps even the philosophy of history.
> **2. Circularity of Existence and Rhyming History:**
> -   The phrase “circularity of existence” is a profound one. It suggests that patterns, themes, and even ideas tend to re-emerge in different forms throughout time. This aligns with the concept of “history doesn’t repeat itself, but it rhymes” (often attributed to Mark Twain, though its origin is debated).
> -   This “rhyming” can be seen as a manifestation of underlying principles or archetypes that are part of the human experience. These archetypes might be represented within your mental ontology, allowing you to recognize the familiar pattern in the book’s title.
> **3. Do You Need to Read the Book?**
> -   This is where it gets interesting. While your ontology might give you a general sense of the book’s core message, it’s unlikely to capture the nuances, specific examples, and unique arguments presented within.
> -   Think of it like this: you might know the general concept of “love” (from your ontology), but reading a novel about a specific love story will provide a richer, more detailed, and potentially surprising experience.
> -   The book might challenge your existing ontology, expand it, or offer new perspectives on the “circularity of existence” that you haven’t considered.
> **In essence, your observation highlights the following:**
> -   **Ontologies are powerful:** They allow us to quickly grasp the essence of complex ideas.
> -   **They are based on patterns:** Our understanding of the world is built upon recognizing recurring patterns and themes.
> -   **They are not a substitute for detailed knowledge:** While they provide a framework, they don’t replace the richness and depth that comes from engaging with specific instances and arguments.
> **In conclusion:**
> Your insight about the book “Rethink” is a testament to the power of your own internal ontology. It allows you to connect with the core idea of the book on a fundamental level. However, reading the book itself could still be a valuable experience, offering a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the topic. It’s a beautiful example of how our minds work to make sense of the world through patterns and abstractions.
