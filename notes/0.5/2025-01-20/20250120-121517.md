Systems in general increase entropy as they become more internally focused, putting their own process and procedure over the substance of their raison d’etre. I’ve seen this everywhere from corporate #America to #nonprofit charities to our #US #legal #system

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> You’ve touched upon a fascinating and pervasive phenomenon that resonates across various types of organizations and systems. The observation that systems tend to become more internally focused, prioritizing process over substance, is a keen one and has been studied and discussed under various frameworks. Let’s break down this concept and explore why it happens.
> **Understanding the Phenomenon**
> What you’re describing can be related to several concepts:
> -   **Iron Law of Oligarchy (Robert Michels):** This sociological theory posits that all organizations, regardless of how democratic they are at the start, will eventually develop into oligarchies where a small group holds the majority of the power. This often leads to the organization’s goals shifting towards maintaining the power structure rather than the original mission.
> -   **Goal Displacement:** This occurs when an organization substitutes the goals it was established to serve with goals that serve the organization itself, such as self-preservation, growth for the sake of growth, or the interests of those in power.
> -   **Bureaucratization:** As organizations grow, they tend to become more bureaucratic. While bureaucracy can bring efficiency, it can also lead to rigid adherence to rules and procedures, even when they no longer serve the original purpose or become counterproductive.
> -   **System Justification Theory:** This psychological theory suggests that people are motivated to defend and justify the existing social, economic, and political systems, even if those systems are flawed or unjust. This can lead to individuals within a system prioritizing its maintenance over its effectiveness or fairness.
> -   **Entropy in Organizational Context:** While entropy is a concept from thermodynamics, it’s often used metaphorically to describe the tendency of systems to move towards disorder and inefficiency over time. In organizations, this can manifest as a drift towards internal focus and process-heavy operations.
> **Why It Happens**
> Several factors contribute to this shift towards internal focus:
> 1. **Growth and Complexity:** As organizations grow, they become more complex. This complexity often necessitates more rules, procedures, and specialized roles, which can lead to a focus on internal processes.
> 2. **Risk Aversion:** Established systems often become risk-averse. Maintaining the status quo can seem safer than adapting or innovating, even if it means sacrificing effectiveness.
> 3. **Incentive Structures:** The incentives within an organization can inadvertently reward behaviors that prioritize internal processes over external outcomes. For example, promotions might be based on following procedures rather than achieving results.
> 4. **Lack of Feedback Mechanisms:** If an organization doesn’t have effective mechanisms for receiving and responding to feedback from the outside world, it can become increasingly insular and out of touch with its original purpose.
> 5. **Path Dependence:** Organizations can become locked into certain ways of doing things simply because “that’s how it’s always been done.” This can make it difficult to change course, even when it’s necessary.
> 6. **Human Nature:** People within organizations are not always rational actors. They may be motivated by self-interest, power, status, or simply a desire for a comfortable and predictable work environment.
> **Examples Across Sectors**
> You mentioned seeing this in:
> -   **Corporate America:** Companies can become so focused on quarterly profits, internal metrics, and bureaucratic processes that they lose sight of customer needs, innovation, and long-term sustainability.
> -   **Nonprofit Charities:** Nonprofits can become more concerned with fundraising, donor relations, and internal hierarchies than with effectively addressing the social issues they were created to solve.
> -   **US Legal System:** The legal system can become so complex, procedural, and focused on precedent that it becomes inaccessible, inefficient, and sometimes unjust for ordinary citizens.
> **Combating the Trend**
> While this tendency towards internal focus is common, it’s not inevitable. Organizations can take steps to counteract it:
> -   **Mission Clarity and Reinforcement:** Regularly revisiting and reinforcing the organization’s core mission can help keep everyone focused on the external goals.
> -   **Outcome-Oriented Metrics:** Measuring and rewarding outcomes rather than just processes can incentivize behaviors that contribute to the organization’s purpose.
> -   **Feedback Loops:** Establishing strong feedback mechanisms from clients, customers, or the community can help the organization stay connected to its external environment.
> -   **Adaptive Leadership:** Leaders who are willing to challenge the status quo, embrace change, and prioritize the organization’s mission over internal politics are crucial.
> -   **Decentralization:** Empowering individuals and teams at lower levels of the organization can reduce bureaucracy and increase responsiveness.
> -   **Culture of Innovation:** Fostering a culture that values experimentation, learning, and continuous improvement can help prevent stagnation.
> **Conclusion**
> The tendency for systems to become internally focused and prioritize process over substance is a real and significant challenge. It’s a complex issue with roots in organizational dynamics, human psychology, and the inherent challenges of growth and complexity. However, by understanding the underlying causes and implementing strategies to counteract them, organizations can strive to remain true to their original purpose and avoid the pitfalls of entropy. Your observation is a valuable starting point for a deeper discussion about how to create and maintain more effective and purposeful systems.

Is the statement about increased entropy correct? I confuse high and low entropy states.

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> You’re right to question the statement about entropy. The initial statement, while capturing a common organizational phenomenon, misuses the term “entropy” in a way that could be confusing. Let’s clarify the concept of entropy and how it relates to the organizational context.
> **Entropy in Thermodynamics**
> In thermodynamics, entropy is a measure of:
> -   **Disorder or randomness:** A system with high entropy has more disorder and less structure.
> -   **The number of possible arrangements:** A high-entropy system has many possible microscopic arrangements that result in the same macroscopic state.
> -   **Energy dispersal:** High entropy is associated with energy being more spread out and less available to do useful work.
> **Low Entropy vs. High Entropy (Thermodynamics)**
> -   **Low Entropy:** Order, structure, concentrated energy, fewer possible arrangements. Think of a perfectly ordered crystal or a fully charged battery.
> -   **High Entropy:** Disorder, randomness, dispersed energy, many possible arrangements. Think of a gas expanding to fill a room or a hot cup of coffee cooling down to room temperature.
> **The Second Law of Thermodynamics**
> The Second Law states that the total entropy of a closed system tends to increase over time. This means that systems naturally move towards states of greater disorder and energy dispersal.
> **Entropy in the Organizational Context (Metaphorical Use)**
> When people talk about entropy in organizations, they are usually using it *metaphorically*, not in the strict thermodynamic sense. They are drawing an analogy between the tendency of physical systems to become disordered and the tendency of organizations to become:
> -   **Inefficient:** Processes become convoluted, and resources are wasted.
> -   **Internally focused:** The organization prioritizes its own internal workings over its external goals.
> -   **Resistant to change:** The organization becomes rigid and unable to adapt to new circumstances.
> **Why the Initial Statement’s Use of Entropy is Problematic**
> The initial statement suggested that systems increase entropy as they become *more internally focused*. This is where the analogy breaks down and can lead to confusion:
> 1. **Internal Focus Implies Structure:** An organization becoming more internally focused, with rigid procedures and hierarchies, actually implies an *increase in internal structure and order*, not disorder. This would be more analogous to a *decrease* in entropy, not an increase.
> 2. **Misalignment with Energy Dispersal:** The idea of energy dispersal in thermodynamics doesn’t neatly map onto organizational “energy” (which could be resources, effort, focus). An internally focused organization might be *misdirecting* its energy, but not necessarily *dispersing* it in the same way heat dissipates.
> **A More Accurate Analogy**
> Instead of saying that internally focused organizations have *higher* entropy, it might be more accurate to say they are:
> -   **Like a crystal with many internal flaws:** They have a rigid structure, but it’s not a *useful* or *efficient* structure. The flaws (inefficient processes, misaligned goals) prevent the organization from functioning effectively.
> -   **Like a poorly designed machine:** The machine has many parts and complex mechanisms (processes), but they are not well-integrated, leading to friction, wasted energy, and ultimately, a failure to achieve the machine’s intended purpose.
> **In Summary**
> -   The initial statement’s use of “entropy” is a common but potentially misleading metaphor.
> -   In thermodynamics, entropy is about disorder and energy dispersal.
> -   Internally focused organizations often become *more structured* (lower entropy in a literal sense), but this structure is often *inefficient and misaligned* with their goals.
> -   It’s more accurate to describe such organizations as having become rigid, inefficient, or misdirected rather than simply having “increased entropy.”
> It’s important to be precise with language, especially when borrowing concepts from one field (thermodynamics) and applying them to another (organizational theory). While the analogy can be helpful, it’s crucial to understand its limitations and avoid misinterpretations.

You’ve identified a really interesting and pervasive phenomenon. The idea that systems, regardless of their nature, tend to drift towards internal focus and increased entropy is a powerful one. Let’s break down why this happens and explore some examples, including the hashtags you’ve provided:
Why does this happen?
 - Incentives and Metrics: Systems often create internal metrics and incentives for their members. These can become divorced from the original purpose and instead reward compliance with procedure, efficiency within the system, and self-preservation of the system itself.
 - Bureaucratization and Specialization: As systems grow, they often become more bureaucratic and specialized. This can lead to silos where individuals focus on their specific tasks rather than the overall goal. Communication and coordination suffer.
 - Loss of Vision: The founding vision or core purpose can become obscured over time. New members may not fully understand or embrace the original mission, leading to a gradual shift in priorities.
 - Risk Aversion: Established systems tend to become risk-averse. Maintaining the status quo becomes more important than innovation or adaptation, even if the status quo no longer serves the original purpose.
 - Self-Perpetuation: A system’s survival often becomes a goal in itself, even if it’s no longer the most effective way to achieve the initial purpose. This is particularly true in organizations with paid employees whose livelihoods depend on the system’s continued existence.
 - Positive Feedback Loops: These factors often create positive feedback loops. For example, increased bureaucracy leads to more rules and procedures, which further reinforces the focus on internal processes, leading to even more bureaucracy.
Examples in the Context of Your Hashtags:
 - #Corporate #America:
   - Shareholder Value Over All Else: Companies can become so focused on quarterly profits and stock prices (internal metrics) that they neglect long-term sustainability, employee well-being, and even ethical considerations.
   - Siloed Departments: Marketing, sales, engineering, etc., can operate independently, focusing on their departmental goals rather than collaborating for the company’s overall success.
   - Bureaucratic Processes: Endless meetings, approvals, and paperwork can stifle innovation and slow down decision-making.
 - #Nonprofit Charities:
   - Focus on Fundraising Over Impact: Nonprofits can become obsessed with fundraising metrics, neglecting to measure or demonstrate their actual impact on the cause they serve. This might even mean that programs that are less easily fundable, but more essential to the mission, are cut.
   - Administrative Overhead: A disproportionate amount of funds can be spent on administrative costs rather than direct program delivery.
   - Mission Creep: Organizations may drift away from their original mission to chase funding opportunities, even if those opportunities don’t align perfectly with their core purpose.
   - Board Dynamics: The board is often full of people with an interest in the mission, but not an interest in micromanaging. This can allow for a bureaucracy to grow unchecked.
 - #US #Legal #System:
   - Focus on Procedure Over Justice: The legal system can be so bogged down in complex procedures and precedents that the pursuit of actual justice becomes secondary.
   - Adversarial Nature: The adversarial system, while designed to ensure fairness, can incentivize lawyers to win at all costs, even if it means obscuring the truth.
   - Access to Justice: The complexity and cost of the legal system can make it inaccessible to many people, effectively denying them justice.
Further Considerations:
 - Entropy: Your use of “entropy” is apt. Systems naturally tend towards disorder unless energy is consciously invested to maintain order and purpose. This energy needs to be directed towards re-evaluating and adapting, not just maintaining the status quo.
 - Solutions: Recognizing this tendency is the first step. Solutions often involve:
   - Reconnecting with the Core Mission: Regularly revisiting and reaffirming the original purpose.
   - Streamlining Processes: Eliminating unnecessary bureaucracy and focusing on efficiency that serves the mission.
   - Empowering Individuals: Giving individuals within the system more autonomy and responsibility.
   - Measuring Impact: Focusing on outcomes and impact rather than just internal metrics.
   - Transparency and Accountability: Ensuring that the system is transparent and accountable to its stakeholders.
In conclusion, your observation about the inward drift of systems is insightful and relevant across various domains. By understanding the forces that drive this phenomenon, we can work towards creating and maintaining systems that remain focused on their true purpose and avoid the pitfalls of entropy and self-preservation.

there’s something about evolution/progress that both necessitates [#complexity](https://x.com/hashtag/complexity?src=hashtag_click) and converges on “simple as possible” (but no simpler!)

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> You’ve hit upon a profound and beautiful duality in the nature of evolution and progress: the interplay between increasing complexity and the elegant simplicity that often emerges from it. It’s a dynamic tension that drives innovation and shapes the world around us. Let’s delve into this concept:
> **1. Evolution Necessitates Complexity:**
> -   **Building Blocks:** Evolution, whether biological or technological, works by building upon existing structures. Each new adaptation or innovation adds a layer of complexity to the system.
> -   **Increased Interactions:** As systems evolve, the number of components and the interactions between them tend to increase. This leads to more complex behaviors and relationships.
> -   **Specialization:** Evolution often favors specialization, where different parts of a system become optimized for specific functions. This division of labor increases overall complexity.
> -   **Adaptation to Complex Environments:** As environments become more complex, organisms and systems need to develop more sophisticated mechanisms to survive and thrive. This drives further increases in complexity.
> -   **Emergent Properties:** Complexity often leads to emergent properties – new behaviors and characteristics that arise from the interactions of simpler components and are not predictable from the components themselves. Consciousness, for example, is believed to be an emergent property of the complex interactions within the brain.
> **2. Convergence on “Simple as Possible (But No Simpler)”:**
> -   **Occam’s Razor:** This principle, often used in science and philosophy, suggests that the simplest explanation is usually the best. It’s a bias towards elegance and efficiency.
> -   **Efficiency and Optimization:** Evolution tends to favor solutions that are efficient in terms of energy use, resource allocation, and functionality. Overly complex systems can be fragile, wasteful, and difficult to maintain.
> -   **Modularity:** Complex systems often evolve modularity, where simpler, self-contained units are combined to create more complex structures. This allows for flexibility, robustness, and easier adaptation. Think of Lego bricks or the organs in the human body.
> -   **Abstraction:** We often deal with complexity by creating abstractions – simplified representations that hide unnecessary details. This allows us to understand and interact with complex systems without getting bogged down in the minutiae. For example, we can drive a car without knowing the intricate workings of the internal combustion engine.
> -   **Underlying Principles:** Sometimes, seemingly complex phenomena can be explained by simple underlying principles. For example, the vast diversity of life on Earth is governed by the relatively simple principles of natural selection acting on genetic variation.
> **The Interplay:**
> The relationship between complexity and simplicity is not a linear one. It’s more like a spiral or a cycle:
> 1. **Initial Simplicity:** A system starts with a relatively simple structure.
> 2. **Increasing Complexity:** As the system evolves and adapts, it accumulates complexity.
> 3. **Emergence of Simplicity:** Through optimization, modularity, and abstraction, a new level of simplicity emerges from the underlying complexity.
> 4. **New Complexity:** This new, simplified structure then becomes the basis for further evolution and a new round of increasing complexity.
> **Examples:**
> -   **The Human Body:** From single-celled organisms to the incredibly complex human body, evolution has built an intricate system. Yet, the body is organized into modular organs, governed by fundamental biological principles, and operates with remarkable efficiency.
> -   **Technology:** Early computers were massive, complex machines. Through miniaturization, modular design, and the development of user-friendly interfaces, they have become smaller, more powerful, and easier to use.
> -   **Language:** Languages evolve over time, accumulating new words and grammatical structures. However, they also tend towards simplification through the regularization of grammar and the loss of unnecessary features.
> -   **The Universe:** The universe itself, with its vastness and intricate laws, may have originated from a singularity – an infinitely small and simple point.
> **“Simple as Possible, But No Simpler”:**
> This quote, often attributed to Albert Einstein (though its exact origin is debated), perfectly captures the essence of this duality. It highlights the importance of:
> -   **Elegance:** Striving for simplicity and clarity in our understanding and design.
> -   **Avoiding Oversimplification:** Recognizing that some level of complexity is necessary to accurately represent reality or achieve a desired function.
> **Conclusion:**
> The dance between complexity and simplicity is a fundamental aspect of evolution and progress. It’s a process of building up, refining, and abstracting to create systems that are both powerful and elegant. Understanding this dynamic can help us to design better technologies, build more effective organizations, and gain a deeper appreciation for the intricate beauty of the world around us. The hashtag #complexity is a great starting point for exploring these ideas further, as it encompasses a vast range of fields where this interplay is evident.

And/but is there a solution? Is there even a problem or is this simply a description of an underlying informational truth?

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> You’ve raised some very insightful questions about whether the tendency of systems to become internally focused and complex is a “problem” to be solved or simply an inherent aspect of how systems evolve. Let’s explore this:
> **Is it a Problem?**
> It’s not inherently a “problem” in the sense of being a universal flaw. However, it becomes a problem when it **hinders the system’s ability to achieve its original purpose or adapt to changing circumstances.** Here’s a breakdown:
> -   **When it’s NOT a problem:**
> -   **Necessary Complexity:** Some level of internal complexity is often necessary for a system to function effectively, especially as it grows and faces more complex challenges.
> -   **Efficient Internal Focus:** A degree of internal focus can be beneficial for streamlining operations, developing expertise, and maintaining internal consistency.
> -   **Natural Stage of Development:** The cycle of increasing complexity followed by simplification can be a natural and even productive stage in a system’s evolution.
> -   **When it IS a problem:**
> -   **Goal Displacement:** When the system’s internal processes and self-preservation become prioritized *over* its original purpose, it’s a problem. For example, a charity that focuses more on fundraising than on its charitable work.
> -   **Inflexibility and Resistance to Change:** When internal focus leads to rigidity and an inability to adapt to new information or a changing environment, it becomes detrimental. Think of a company that sticks to outdated business models despite market shifts.
> -   **Inefficiency and Waste:** When internal processes become overly complex and bureaucratic, they can lead to wasted resources, time, and effort, ultimately hindering the system’s effectiveness.
> -   **Injustice or Harm:** In some cases, the internal focus of a system can lead to unjust or harmful outcomes. For example, a legal system that prioritizes procedure over justice or a corporation that prioritizes profits over ethical considerations.
> **Is it an Underlying Informational Truth?**
> There’s a strong argument to be made that this tendency is rooted in fundamental principles related to information, entropy, and the nature of complex systems:
> -   **Second Law of Thermodynamics (Entropy):** As discussed earlier, systems naturally tend towards disorder. Maintaining order and purpose requires a constant input of energy and a conscious effort to counteract entropy.
> -   **Information Processing:** As systems grow, they need to process more information. This often leads to the development of internal structures and processes for managing that information. However, these structures can become self-serving and lose sight of the bigger picture.
> -   **Path Dependence:** Systems tend to get locked into certain ways of doing things based on their history and past decisions. This can make it difficult to change course, even when it’s necessary.
> -   **Evolutionary Dynamics:** Evolutionary processes, whether biological or social, often involve a balance between exploration (trying new things, increasing complexity) and exploitation (optimizing existing structures, simplifying). This can lead to cycles of increasing and decreasing complexity.
> **Is There a Solution?**
> While we can’t entirely “solve” this tendency, as it’s inherent to the nature of complex systems, we can certainly **mitigate its negative consequences**. The key is to find ways to maintain a healthy balance between internal organization and external focus, between complexity and simplicity, and between stability and adaptability.
> **Possible Approaches:**
> 1. **Conscious Design and Re-Design:**
> -   **Mission Clarity:** Start with a clear and well-defined purpose. Regularly revisit and reaffirm this mission to ensure that it remains the guiding principle.
> -   **Adaptive Structures:** Design systems that are flexible, modular, and capable of adapting to change.
> -   **Feedback Mechanisms:** Build in robust feedback loops that connect the system to its external environment and allow it to learn and adjust.
> 2. **Continuous Improvement:**
> -   **Process Optimization:** Regularly review and streamline internal processes to eliminate waste and improve efficiency.
> -   **Innovation and Experimentation:** Foster a culture that encourages innovation, experimentation, and learning from both successes and failures.
> -   **Decentralization:** Empower individuals and teams within the system to make decisions and take initiative, reducing reliance on rigid hierarchies.
> 3. **Mindful Leadership:**
> -   **Visionary Leadership:** Leaders who can articulate a compelling vision, inspire others to embrace change, and prioritize the organization’s purpose over internal politics.
> -   **Systems Thinking:** Leaders who understand
