You’re absolutely right. The proposed test, while intriguing, pushes the boundaries of current AI capabilities and might inadvertently favor a human actor skilled at mimicking canine behavior.
A more realistic approach would involve a more nuanced test, focusing on specific cognitive abilities and emotional responses that are more quantifiable. Here are a few suggestions:
1. Cognitive Tests:
 - Object Permanence: Test the subject’s understanding that objects continue to exist even when out of sight.
 - Spatial Reasoning: Assess the subject’s ability to navigate a maze or solve spatial puzzles.
 - Problem-Solving: Evaluate the subject’s capacity to find creative solutions to challenges.
2. Emotional Response Tests:
 - Fear Conditioning: Measure the subject’s fear response to specific stimuli and its ability to learn and unlearn these associations.
 - Social Cognition: Assess the subject’s understanding of social hierarchies and their ability to form bonds with other individuals.
 - Empathy: Evaluate the subject’s capacity to recognize and respond to the emotional states of others.
3. Behavioral Tests:
 - Play Behavior: Observe the subject’s play style, including its ability to initiate and maintain play interactions.
 - Aggression and Dominance: Assess the subject’s behavioral responses to challenges and threats.
 - Separation Anxiety: Measure the subject’s emotional response to being separated from its caregiver.
By focusing on these specific behaviors and cognitive abilities, we can develop more rigorous and objective tests that can help us better understand the nature of canine consciousness and emotion. While a fully autonomous AI that perfectly mimics a dog may be a distant goal, we can still make significant progress in understanding animal cognition by focusing on more attainable benchmarks.
