I’ve been working around entrepreneurs my entire career. From my earliest days working at a small mom and pop print shop to my previous role working at a software as a service document management company, I have some intuitive idea of what it takes to be successful. So why am I not a millionaire? Because I don’t want to. My interest is in the technical skills and the technical ability needed to succeed, not in the marketing and the sales and all the drudgery that I consider anathema to excellence and quite frankly what I consider to be overhead burdening our monetary economic society.

In my previous post, I said choose poverty. And now I tell you, choose innovation. Choose to help humanity. Choose the path that allows you to use your unique skills. And do it in a way that doesn’t matter what dollar sign is in front of it. Don’t think that you exist to live in a mansion or have a billion dollars.
