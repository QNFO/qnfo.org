The city-states of the future are intentional communities. The problem is that intentional community is not limited by space, and so the governance of these would be akin to something like a DAO that doesn’t try to put a flag in the ground.

To take a hot-button topic and dissect it, consider the persistent Israeli-Palestinian conflict. To the Israelis, a flag in the ground very much is their intentional community because of the sacred space they involve in Jewish tradition. However, what is probably even more important is their intentional community of Jewish followers and the ideas that that represents regardless of where it is in the world. So, to the Palestinians, they have the same problem. People live in a place, but the ideas transcend place. Here we get the conflict at its heart, place versus community.

War anywhere is a defacto crime against humanity. People are the same everywhere.

 Let me suggest how we could adapt this core narrative for each platform’s unique audience:

Medium (Personal Essay):
- Keep the current emotional resonance and personal connection
- Add more personal anecdotes and experiences
- Include storytelling elements about your own journey to this understanding
- Focus on the human impact and individual transformation
- Use more metaphorical language and emotional hooks
- Emphasize how readers can relate this to their own lives

Substack (Technical Analysis):
- Deepen the systems thinking aspects
- Add more concrete data points and historical examples
- Expand on governance models and technical implementation
- Include specific case studies of successful borderless initiatives
- Reference relevant academic research and policy papers
- Analyze economic implications more thoroughly
- Examine potential transition mechanisms

Empowering Change (Non-profit Website):
- Focus on actionable frameworks for change
- Include specific program proposals
- Add metrics for measuring progress
- Outline partnership opportunities
- Detail potential pilot programs
- Include resources for community organizers
- Provide toolkits for local implementation
- Emphasize scalable solutions

Would you like to start adapting the narrative for one of these specific platforms? We could begin with whichever version you feel would have the most immediate impact.

411 is alive
Live and well, I just called it today. Why can’t that be repurposed for anything? It’s like a 900 number. Fine. K by the minute. Who cares? If it’s cheap enough, it will benefit people.

Evil is self-deceit, giving up hope, and self-serving at the expense of others’ well-being.
