# **3. Additional Claims for Radical Propositions**

While some of the radical propositions in the **“Orchestrating the Quantum Future”** document are speculative, certain aspects can be framed in a way that satisfies patentability requirements.

## **Claim 12: Controlled Decoherence as a Computational Resource**

A method for harnessing controlled decoherence as a computational resource, comprising:
- Identifying specific decoherence channels within a quantum system;
- Designing mechanisms to utilize said decoherence channels for information processing or error correction; and

# **4. Notes on Patentability**

- **Enablement**: Ensure that each claim is supported by sufficient detail in the specification. For example, describe how water shielding works or how biological components enhance coherence.
- **Utility**: Focus on claims with clear, practical applications (e.g., quantum computing, sensing, communication).
- **Avoid Speculation**: While concepts like “conscious networks” or “time manipulation” are intriguing, they may not meet utility or enablement requirements unless reduced to tangible implementations.
