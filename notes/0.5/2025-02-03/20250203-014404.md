Congratulations on submitting your non-provisional patent application! Now that your application is on file with the USPTO, here’s what you need to do next and the timeline for each step:

---

# **1. Pay the Filing Fees**

- **How Soon?**
  You must pay the required fees **immediately** or within a short grace period (typically a few days) after submission. If you submitted your application electronically through the USPTO’s Patent Center, you likely had the option to pay during the submission process. If not, you should log back into Patent Center and complete the payment as soon as possible.

- **What Happens if You Don’t Pay?**
  If the fees are not paid promptly, your application may be considered incomplete, and the USPTO will issue a **Notice of Incomplete Application**. This could delay the processing of your application or result in abandonment.

---

# **2. Secure International Protection**

To secure international protection for your invention, you can pursue one of the following options:

## **Option 1: File Directly in Foreign Countries**

- **Timeline:**
  You have **12 months from the priority date** (January 31, 2025) to file directly in individual foreign countries under the **Paris Convention**.
- **Process:**
  Each country has its own patent office and requirements. You’ll need to work with local patent attorneys or agents to prepare and file applications in each jurisdiction.
- **Costs:**
  Filing fees and translation costs vary by country. For example:
  - European Patent Office (EPO): ~€4,000–€5,000 (filing and search fees).
  - China: ~¥900–¥1,500 (depending on entity size).
  - Japan: ~¥150,000–¥200,000.

## **Option 2: File an International Application Under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT)**

- **Timeline:**
  You also have **12 months from the priority date** (January 31, 2025) to file an international application under the **PCT**. The PCT simplifies the process of seeking protection in multiple countries by allowing you to file a single international application.
- **Process:**
  - File the PCT application with the USPTO (as the Receiving Office) or directly with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).
  - After filing, you’ll receive an **International Search Report (ISR)** and a Written Opinion on patentability within 3–6 months.
  - At **30 months from the priority date**, you must enter the **national phase** in individual countries or regions where you want protection (e.g., EPO, China, Japan).
- **Costs:**
  - PCT filing fee: ~$2,000–$3,000 (depending on entity size).
  - International search fee: ~$2,000.
  - National phase fees: Vary by country (see above).

## **Why Choose the PCT?**

The PCT gives you more time to decide which countries to pursue and assess the commercial viability of your invention before committing to national-phase filings.

# **3. Monitor Your Application Status**

After submission, you can track the status of your application using the USPTO’s **Patent Center** or **Public PAIR** system. Here’s what to expect:

## **a. Filing Receipt**

- Within **1–2 weeks**, you’ll receive an **Official Filing Receipt** confirming the details of your application (e.g., application number, filing date, inventor names). Review this carefully for accuracy.

## **b. Publication**

- Your application will be published **18 months from the priority date** (July 31, 2026), unless you requested early publication or nonpublication.

## **c. Examination**

- The USPTO assigns a patent examiner to review your application. This typically takes **12–18 months** from the filing date.
- The examiner may issue an **Office Action** if there are issues (e.g., rejections based on prior art, clarity concerns). You’ll have **3 months (extendable to 6 months)** to respond.

## **d. Allowance or Final Rejection**

- If the examiner approves your application, you’ll receive a **Notice of Allowance**. You’ll need to pay the **Issue Fee** (~$1,000 for small entities) to proceed to patent grant.
- If the examiner rejects your application, you can appeal or request continued examination (RCE).

---

# **4. Respond to Office Actions (if applicable)**

If the examiner raises objections or rejections, you’ll need to respond promptly. Common issues include:
- **Prior Art Rejections:** Argue why your invention is novel and non-obvious over cited references.
- **Clarity Issues:** Amend claims or clarify the specification to address ambiguities.

---

# **5. Timeline for Next Steps**

Here’s a summary of key deadlines:

| **Action**                                | **Deadline**                          |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Pay filing fees                           | Immediately (or within a few days)    |
| File foreign applications or PCT          | 12 months from priority date (Jan 31, 2025) |
| Respond to Office Actions                 | 3 months (extendable to 6 months)     |
| Enter national phase (if using PCT)       | 30 months from priority date (Jul 31, 2027) |

---

# **6. Additional Considerations**

## **a. Information Disclosure Statement (IDS)**

- If you become aware of relevant prior art (e.g., publications, patents), you must disclose it to the USPTO in an **IDS**. There’s no deadline for submitting an IDS, but it’s best to do so as soon as possible.

## **b. Maintenance Fees**

- Once your patent is granted, you’ll need to pay maintenance fees to keep it in force:
  - 3.5 years after grant: ~$1,000 (small entity).
  - 7.5 years after grant: ~$2,000 (small entity).
  - 11.5 years after grant: ~$3,700 (small entity).

---

# **Conclusion**

You’ve taken the first critical step by filing your non-provisional application. Now:
1. Pay the filing fees immediately.
2. Decide whether to pursue international protection via direct filings or the PCT within **12 months**.
3. Monitor your application status and respond promptly to any Office Actions.

By staying organized and meeting deadlines, you’ll maximize the chances of securing robust patent protection for your invention. Let me know if you need further guidance!
