# Patent Application: Water-Shielded Quantum Devices with Engineered Ordered Water Structures for Ambient-Temperature Coherence

## Cross-Reference to Related Applications

[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/751,887, filed January 31, 2025, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

## Field of the Invention

[0002] The present invention relates generally to quantum technologies and, more specifically, to devices and methods for maintaining quantum coherence at ambient temperatures using engineered water shielding mechanisms.

## Background of the Invention

[0003] Quantum coherence is essential for quantum computing, sensing, and communication. However, maintaining coherence typically requires extreme conditions, such as cryogenic cooling or vacuum isolation, which are costly, energy-intensive, and limit scalability. Recent insights from quantum biology suggest that ordered water structures around biological molecules, such as microtubules, may shield quantum states and sustain coherence at ambient temperatures. Despite these findings, there is a lack of practical platforms for leveraging these bio-inspired mechanisms in artificial quantum systems.

## Summary of the Invention

[0004] The invention provides a water-shielded quantum device for maintaining quantum coherence at ambient temperatures. Key aspects include a quantum component surrounded by a water-based shielding mechanism engineered to mimic ordered water structures found in biological systems. Mechanisms for maintaining ordered water structures include nanostructured surfaces, external electric fields, or additives that promote hydrogen bonding. The invention also includes integration into undersea fiber optic cables for scalable quantum networks.

## Detailed Description of the Invention

### Water Shielding Mechanism

[0005] The water-based shielding mechanism is engineered to mimic ordered water structures found in biological systems. These structures reduce environmental interactions that cause decoherence, enabling quantum devices to operate at ambient temperatures.

#### Nanostructured Surfaces

[0006] The quantum component is surrounded by a chamber lined with nanostructured surfaces coated with hydrophilic materials. These surfaces induce ordering of water molecules through physical interactions, such as hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces.

#### External Electric Fields

[0007] An external electric field generator is integrated into the device to align water molecules around the quantum component. The electric field is applied using electrodes positioned around the water chamber.

#### Additives

[0008] Additives are incorporated into the water to promote hydrogen bonding and stabilize ordered water structures. Suitable additives include salts, surfactants, and polymers.

### Quantum Component

[0009] The quantum component is selected from the group consisting of qubits, quantum sensors, and quantum repeaters. Each type of quantum component is designed to operate within the water-shielded environment.

### Hybrid Approaches

[0010] To address concerns about reliability, the invention includes hybrid shielding mechanisms that combine water shielding with other techniques, such as cryogenic cooling or polymer-based encapsulation.

### Integration into Undersea Cables

[0011] The water-shielded quantum repeaters are integrated into undersea fiber optic cables. The cables are modified to include water chambers surrounding the quantum repeaters.

### Experimental Validation

[0012] While experimental data is currently limited, computational models demonstrate the feasibility of water shielding. Future experiments will focus on testing water-shielded devices in controlled environments.
