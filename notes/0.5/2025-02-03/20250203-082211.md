## **Field Of the Invention**

The present invention relates generally to quantum technologies and, more specifically, to devices and methods for maintaining quantum coherence at ambient temperatures using engineered water shielding mechanisms.

---

## **Background Of the Invention**

Quantum coherence is essential for quantum computing, sensing, and communication. However, maintaining coherence typically requires extreme conditions, such as cryogenic cooling or vacuum isolation, which are costly, energy-intensive, and limit scalability [[releases/alpha/Converging Reality/Theme 1]]. Recent insights from quantum biology suggest that ordered water structures around biological molecules, such as microtubules, may shield quantum states and sustain coherence at ambient temperatures [[5 Interaction with Physical Laws]]. Despite these promising findings, there is a lack of practical platforms and methods for leveraging these bio-inspired mechanisms in artificial quantum systems. The present invention addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive solution for maintaining quantum coherence using engineered water shielding mechanisms.

## **Summary Of the Invention**

The invention provides a water-shielded quantum device for maintaining quantum coherence at ambient temperatures. Key aspects of the invention include:
- A quantum component (e.g., qubits, quantum sensors, and quantum repeaters) surrounded by a water-based shielding mechanism engineered to mimic ordered water structures found in biological systems.
- Mechanisms for maintaining ordered water structures, such as nanostructured surfaces, external electric fields, or additives that promote hydrogen bonding.
- Integration of water-shielded quantum devices into undersea fiber optic cables for scalable quantum networks.

The invention also explores hybrid approaches that combine water shielding with other mechanisms (e.g., cryogenic cooling or polymer-based encapsulation) to enhance reliability and performance.

## **Detailed Description of the Invention**

### **1. Water Shielding Mechanism**

The water-based shielding mechanism is engineered to mimic ordered water structures found in biological systems. These structures are hypothesized to reduce environmental interactions that cause decoherence, enabling quantum devices to operate at ambient temperatures. Specific methods for achieving ordered water structures include:

- **Nanostructured Surfaces**:
  The quantum component is surrounded by a chamber lined with nanostructured surfaces coated with hydrophilic materials. These surfaces induce ordering of water molecules through physical interactions, such as hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces. The nanostructures are fabricated using advanced techniques, such as molecular self-assembly or 3D printing, to achieve precise control over their geometry and surface properties.

- **External Electric Fields**:
  An external electric field generator is integrated into the device to align water molecules around the quantum component. The electric field is applied using electrodes positioned around the water chamber. The strength and frequency of the electric field are optimized to maintain the desired alignment of water molecules.

- **Additives**:
  Additives are incorporated into the water to promote hydrogen bonding and stabilize ordered water structures. Suitable additives include salts, surfactants, and polymers that interact favorably with water molecules. For example, polyethylene glycol (PEG) can be used to enhance hydrogen bonding and increase the viscosity of the water, reducing thermal fluctuations.

### **2. Quantum Component**

The quantum component is selected from the group consisting of qubits, quantum sensors, and quantum repeaters. Each type of quantum component is designed to operate within the water-shielded environment. For example:
- **Qubits**: Superconducting qubits or trapped ions are encapsulated within the water chamber. The water shielding reduces environmental noise, enabling longer coherence times.
- **Quantum Sensors**: Sensors are designed to measure physical quantities with high precision while operating within the water-shielded environment.
- **Quantum Repeaters**: Repeaters are integrated into undersea fiber optic cables, where the water shielding enhances entanglement distribution over long distances.

### **3. Hybrid Approaches**

To address concerns about reliability, the invention includes hybrid shielding mechanisms that combine water shielding with other techniques, such as:
- Cryogenic cooling for critical components.
- Polymer-based encapsulation to protect against contamination or evaporation.

### **4. Integration into Undersea Cables**

The water-shielded quantum repeaters are integrated into undersea fiber optic cables. The cables are modified to include water chambers surrounding the quantum repeaters. The chambers are sealed to prevent evaporation and contamination, ensuring long-term stability.

### **5. Experimental Validation**

While experimental data is currently limited, computational models demonstrate the feasibility of water shielding. Future experiments will focus on:
- Testing water-shielded devices in controlled environments.
- Measuring coherence times under varying conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure).
