# Patent Application: Liquid-Shielded Quantum Device for Enhanced Coherence

---

## **Cross-Reference to Related Applications**
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/751,887, filed January 31, 2025, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

---

## **Field of the Invention**
[0002] The present invention relates generally to quantum computing and, more specifically, to liquid-shielded quantum devices and methods for enhancing quantum coherence at ambient temperatures.

---

## **Background of the Invention**
[0003] Quantum coherence is essential for the operation of quantum computers, sensors, and communication systems. However, maintaining coherence over extended periods remains a significant challenge due to decoherence caused by environmental interactions. Current methods for maintaining coherence typically rely on extreme conditions, such as cryogenic cooling to millikelvin temperatures or vacuum isolation to ultra-low pressures, which are inherently costly, energy-intensive, and pose significant challenges to scalability and widespread deployment.

[0004] Recent research in quantum biology has provided intriguing evidence suggesting that ordered liquid structures, particularly those formed around biomolecules like microtubules, may play a crucial role in shielding quantum states from environmental noise and sustaining coherence even at ambient temperatures. These findings offer a promising new avenue for achieving robust quantum coherence in artificial systems. Despite these insights, there remains a critical need for practical platforms and device architectures that can effectively leverage these bio-inspired mechanisms.

## **Summary of the Invention**
[0005] The invention provides a liquid-shielded quantum device and associated methods for enhancing quantum coherence at ambient temperatures. Key aspects include:
1. A liquid-based shielding mechanism engineered to mimic ordered liquid structures found in biological systems.
2. Mechanisms for reducing environmental interactions that cause decoherence, enabling quantum devices to operate without the need for cryogenic cooling or vacuum isolation.
3. Applications in quantum computing, quantum sensing, and quantum communication.

[0006] The device incorporates a liquid chamber surrounding the quantum component, configured to maintain ordered liquid structures through mechanisms such as external electric fields, nanostructured surfaces, or additives that promote hydrogen bonding. This approach enables scalable quantum technologies without the need for extreme cooling or isolation.

## **Detailed Description of the Invention**

### **Liquid-Based Shielding Mechanism**
[0007] The core of the invention lies in the design of a liquid-based shielding mechanism that is specifically engineered to mimic the ordered liquid structures observed in biological systems, where coherent quantum processes are known to persist at ambient temperatures. By replicating these naturally occurring structures, the shielding mechanism aims to minimize the detrimental interactions between the quantum component and its surrounding environment, which are the primary cause of decoherence and the loss of quantum behavior.

[0008] The liquid chamber is configured to establish and maintain ordered liquid structures through one or more of the following mechanisms:
4. Application of an external electric field to induce alignment of liquid molecules.
5. Use of nanostructured surfaces within the liquid chamber to promote ordering of liquid molecules via physical interactions such as hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces.
6. Incorporation of additives into the liquid chamber to enhance hydrogen bonding and stabilize ordered liquid structures.

[0009] These mechanisms collectively reduce environmental noise, enabling the quantum component to maintain coherence at ambient temperatures.

### **Quantum Components**
[0010] The quantum component may be selected from the group consisting of qubits, quantum sensors, and quantum repeaters. The liquid-shielded quantum device is particularly suited for integration into undersea fiber optic cables, enabling long-distance quantum communication without the need for cryogenic cooling.

### **Functional Mechanisms**
[0011] The invention describes specific mechanisms by which quantum coherence is enhanced:
7. Vibrational Coupling: Standing waves within the liquid chamber facilitate long-lived quantum states.
8. Electron Tunneling: Enhanced probabilities of electron tunneling between adjacent sites.
9. Entanglement: Entangled states sustained through vibrational and electromagnetic interactions.

[0012] These mechanisms are applicable across various quantum technologies, including quantum computing, quantum sensing, and quantum communication.

# **Key Adjustments Made**

22. **Broadened Scope for Liquids**:
   - The term “water” has been replaced with “liquid” in key sections to cover not only water but also other liquids with hydrogen-bonding capabilities (e.g., glycerol, ionic liquids). This broadens the scope of protection while maintaining specificity.

23. **Paragraph Numbering**:
   - Sequential paragraph numbering ([0001], [0002], etc.) has been added throughout the specification to comply with USPTO requirements.

24. **Claim Structure**:
   - Claim 1 is broad but not overly complex, covering the core invention (liquid-shielded quantum device).
   - Dependent claims (Claims 2–12) narrow the scope incrementally, providing layered protection.
   - Claims explicitly address alternative implementations (e.g., non-aqueous fluids).

25. **Enablement**:
