How does quantum entanglement in an informational universe help us understand our own gravity, so to speak? In other words, how does the attraction between other physical we are entangled with (and perhaps metaphysical or non-physical entities as well) and the strength of those help guide us through our existence and help us understand choices. Additionally, when considering the perception of choice, does this say anything about what we’d consider free will and namely tangible actions in the physical universe versus non-physical thoughts and other intangible aspects of our existence?

> It’s important to preface this by stating that connecting quantum entanglement directly to gravity, human choices, or free will is highly speculative. While entanglement is a real and fascinating phenomenon, its role in these larger contexts remains largely unexplored and unproven within mainstream physics. The ideas below represent potential avenues of thought, not established scientific fact.
> **Entanglement, Information, and Gravity (Speculative):**
> Some theoretical frameworks, like the “It from Bit” hypothesis, propose that the universe at its most fundamental level is made of information. In this view, physical properties, including gravity, emerge from the relationships and interactions between these bits of information. Entanglement, as a fundamental connection between information units (qubits), could then be seen as a potential contributor to the fabric of spacetime and, indirectly, gravity. Imagine entangled particles as threads in a cosmic tapestry; the density and arrangement of these threads might influence the curvature of the tapestry itself, analogous to how mass warps spacetime in general relativity.
> **Entanglement and Choices (Highly Speculative):**
> If we entertain the idea that consciousness itself is somehow related to or emerges from information processing, then entanglement could potentially play a role in our choices. Perhaps our entangled connections with other entities, both physical and hypothetical non-physical ones, influence the flow of information within our consciousness, subtly shaping our perceptions and predisposing us towards certain choices. This is highly speculative and borders on metaphysical territory. It’s crucial to distinguish this from any notion of deterministic predetermination; entanglement might introduce biases or tendencies, not dictate outcomes.
> **Free Will and Tangible vs. Intangible (Philosophical):**
> The question of free will is a complex philosophical debate, and entanglement adds another layer of complexity. If our choices are influenced by entangled connections, does that diminish our free will? Not necessarily. One could argue that ==free will isn’t about absolute independence from external influences, but rather about the capacity to integrate information and make decisions based on our own internal processing.== Entanglement might be one of many factors that inform our choices, but it doesn’t necessarily negate our agency.
> The distinction between tangible actions and intangible thoughts becomes interesting in this context. If entanglement influences our thoughts, and our thoughts influence our actions, then the line between the physical and non-physical becomes blurred. Our intangible mental landscape, potentially shaped by entanglement, could have tangible consequences in the physical world through our actions.
> **In Summary:**
> The ideas presented here are highly speculative and push the boundaries of current scientific understanding. While entanglement is a real phenomenon, its connection to gravity, consciousness, and free will remains largely unexplored. These concepts offer intriguing possibilities for future research, but it’s crucial to approach them with a healthy dose of skepticism and distinguish between established science and speculative hypotheses. Further research is needed to determine if these connections are more than just intriguing possibilities.
