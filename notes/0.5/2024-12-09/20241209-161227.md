A simple test, call it the test of goodness, or hypocrite test, depending on your optimism or pessimism, but the idea is when we state an action, and in particular when we state that something is for the benefit of others, how do we know and how do others know that that’s the case? Because we may not know that we are actually self-serving. Use game theory here. Do I benefit in any meaningful way for my action toward others? Am I serving others or creating more paperwork and rationale or justification for my own cause? This could be me as an individual, this could be me as an organization. What’s the end result? Is it actually helping people? And how? If I say I want to do good, but doing good fits only in my box of Well, that’s not really good. That’s making me feel better. And if I’m just existing as, let’s say, a tax exempt nonprofit organization for my own tax exempt status and saying, oh, well, we helped all these people and look at all the extra work we gave ourselves to justify our continued existence. That’s hypocrisy, not service to humanity.

> This “test of goodness” aligns perfectly with several concepts in game theory, particularly focusing on the potential for strategic behavior and the difficulty of discerning genuine altruism from self-interest. Let’s analyze it through a few game-theoretic lenses:
> **1. The Prisoner’s Dilemma and its variations:** The core issue is the conflict between individual rationality and collective good. Consider a simplified scenario:
> - **Action:** An organization (Player A) claims to help the poor (Player B). They could invest resources in genuinely effective programs (Cooperation) or use resources for administrative bloat and self-promotion (Defection).
> - **Payoffs:** The payoffs are complex and depend on several factors:
> - **Genuine impact:** Does the program actually help the poor? If so, Player B benefits.
> - **Reputation:** Does Player A gain positive reputation (leading to more donations, grants, etc.)? This is a payoff for Player A, regardless of the actual impact on Player B.
> - **Tax benefits:** Does Player A maintain its tax-exempt status? This is another payoff for Player A.
> - **Internal satisfaction:** Does Player A experience personal satisfaction from the perceived act of helping? This is a subjective payoff.
> The Prisoner’s Dilemma arises because Player A might defect (self-serving actions) even if cooperation (genuine help) would yield a better overall outcome. The temptation to maximize individual gain (reputation, tax benefits, self-satisfaction) can outweigh the benefit to Player B. Variations like the repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma (long-term interactions) add complexity, as reputation and trust become important factors.
> **2. Signaling Games:** Player A’s actions (e.g., publishing reports, holding fundraising events) can be seen as signals intended to convince others (donors, the public, the government) of their altruism. However, these signals can be costly to fake (e.g., producing detailed reports requires resources), making them partially credible. The effectiveness of the signal depends on the audience’s ability to assess its authenticity. A sophisticated audience might be less easily fooled by superficial signals.
> **3. Public Goods Games:** The provision of aid to the poor can be modeled as a public good. Everyone benefits from a reduction in poverty, but individuals might be tempted to free-ride (not contribute) while still enjoying the benefits of others’ contributions. This highlights the challenge of motivating genuine altruism in a system where self-interest can be easily disguised.
> **4. Mechanism Design:** The question of how to ensure genuine altruism leads to the field of mechanism design. This branch of game theory explores how to design systems (e.g., regulations, auditing processes) to incentivize cooperation and discourage defection. For example, rigorous independent audits of non-profits could help reduce the incentive for self-serving behavior.
> **The End Result:** The end result depends on the interplay of these game-theoretic factors. A truly beneficial action requires a combination of:
> - **Effective programs:** The action must genuinely address the needs of those it aims to help.
> - **Transparency and accountability:** The organization’s actions and impact must be verifiable and transparent.
> - **Strong incentives for genuine altruism:** The system should reward genuine help and penalize self-serving behavior.
> Without these elements, the “test of goodness” will likely fail, revealing the hypocrisy inherent in actions driven primarily by self-interest, even if cloaked in the language of altruism. The challenge lies in designing systems and fostering a culture that prioritizes genuine impact over self-serving justifications.

Write it. Intent is to post as a sub-stack article.

> ## The Hypocrite’s Dilemma: Can We Really Measure Altruism?
> We live in a world saturated with claims of altruism. Non-profits trumpet their impact, corporations boast of their social responsibility, and individuals proudly share their charitable acts. But how do we know if these claims are genuine? How can we distinguish genuine compassion from cleverly disguised self-interest? This question, a modern-day riddle wrapped in a cloak of good intentions, finds a surprisingly apt framework in game theory.
> The “test of goodness,” as we might call it, boils down to this: when someone claims an action benefits others, how do we – and they – know it’s true? The problem isn’t simply malice; it’s the insidious nature of self-deception. We may genuinely *believe* we’re acting altruistically, while unconsciously prioritizing our own needs – be it ego-boosting, social status, or tax breaks.
> Game theory provides a powerful lens through which to examine this “hypocrite’s dilemma.” Several models illuminate the complexities of altruism versus self-interest:
> **1. The Prisoner’s Dilemma of Doing Good:**
> Imagine a non-profit (Player A) claiming to alleviate poverty (Player B). They can choose to invest resources in effective programs (Cooperation) or divert funds to administrative bloat and self-promotion (Defection). The payoffs are multifaceted:
> - **Genuine Impact:** Does the program actually help the poor? This directly benefits Player B.
> - **Reputation:** Does Player A gain positive publicity, attracting more donations? This benefits Player A regardless of Player B’s outcome.
> - **Tax Benefits:** Does Player A maintain its tax-exempt status? Another payoff for Player A.
> - **Internal Satisfaction:** Does Player A experience a personal sense of accomplishment? A subjective, but powerful, payoff.
> The dilemma arises because Player A might defect – prioritizing self-serving actions – even if cooperation would yield a better overall outcome. The temptation to maximize individual gain can outweigh the benefit to Player B. This is especially true in repeated interactions, where reputation plays a crucial role. A non-profit might initially invest in genuine aid, but gradually shift towards self-serving activities as it prioritizes survival and growth.
> **2. The Signaling Game of Altruism:**
> A non-profit’s actions – publishing reports, hosting fundraising galas – are signals intended to convince others of its altruism. However, these signals can be costly to fake. Producing detailed impact reports requires resources, making them partially credible. The effectiveness of the signal depends on the audience’s ability to discern authenticity. A sophisticated donor will be less easily swayed by superficial displays of altruism.
> **3. The Public Goods Problem of Charity:**
> Poverty reduction is a public good. Everyone benefits from a decrease in poverty, but individuals might free-ride, enjoying the benefits of others’ contributions without contributing themselves. This highlights the challenge of motivating genuine altruism in a system where self-interest can be easily masked.
> **4. Mechanism Design: Building Trust and Transparency:**
> The question of how to ensure genuine altruism leads us to mechanism design. This branch of game theory explores how to design systems that incentivize cooperation and discourage defection. Rigorous independent audits, transparent financial reporting, and clear metrics for measuring impact are crucial mechanisms to mitigate the hypocrite’s dilemma.
> **The Verdict: Beyond Good Intentions**
> The “test of goodness” isn’t about judging intentions; it’s about evaluating outcomes. A truly beneficial action requires:
> - **Effective Programs:** The action must genuinely address the needs of those it aims to help.
> - **Transparency and Accountability:** The organization’s actions and impact must be verifiable and transparent.
> - **Strong Incentives for Genuine Altruism:** The system should reward genuine help and penalize self-serving behavior.
> Without these elements, the test fails. The challenge lies in designing systems and fostering a culture that prioritizes genuine impact over self-serving justifications, however well-intentioned they may be. Only then can we move beyond the hypocrisy of altruism and towards a world where doing good truly means doing good.
