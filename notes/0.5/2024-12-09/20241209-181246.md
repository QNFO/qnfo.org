Chained dependent events. That’s how manifestation and synchronicity works. And it’s not linear, so there will be plenty of errors and learning along the way, and that’s how you know you’re doing it right. Because you keep getting tested, and then it will pay off. Your vision, your dreams, will be reality.

Congratulations. You passed the test.
