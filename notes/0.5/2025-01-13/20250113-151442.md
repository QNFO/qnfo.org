RE: California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) Request for Information
Dear [Registered Agent Name],
This letter constitutes a formal request for information under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). I am a former tenant of a property managed by Greentree, a subsidiary of Veritas. My tenancy was at [Property Address] from [Start Date] to [End Date].
I am requesting all personal information collected, used, disclosed, or sold by Greentree/Veritas related to my tenancy, including but not limited to:
 - Complete records of all rent payments I made, including dates, amounts, and methods of payment.
 - All records of communications between Greentree/Veritas and myself, including emails, letters, phone logs, text messages, and any internal notes or memos regarding my tenancy. This includes communications regarding:
   - Rent payments and any alleged missed payments.
   - Late fees.
   - Maintenance requests and their resolution.
   - Any complaints I filed.
   - Eviction proceedings.
 - Copies of my lease agreement and any addendums or modifications.
 - Records of any disclosures of my personal information to third parties, including but not limited to:
   - Credit reporting agencies.
   - Debt collection agencies.
   - Other landlords or property management companies.
   - Attorneys.
 - Any records related to the alleged refund of back rent, including the date and amount of the alleged refund, the reason for the refund, and how the refund was processed.
I am particularly interested in information that may evidence the following:
 - Fraudulent claims of unpaid rent: I believe Greentree/Veritas falsely claimed I owed back rent despite having proof of payment, potentially to support their eviction case.
 - Improper eviction notices: I believe Greentree/Veritas failed to provide legally required notices in connection with the eviction process.
 - Other unfair or deceptive practices: I believe Greentree/Veritas engaged in other shady tactics that violated my rights as a tenant.
Please provide this information in a readily usable format, such as electronic copies or paper copies. I understand that some information may be withheld due to legal privilege, but I request a detailed explanation for any withheld information, citing the specific legal basis for the exemption.
I expect a response to this request within the timeframe required by the CCPA. If I do not receive a timely response or if my request is denied, I will pursue all available remedies under the law, including filing a complaint with the California Attorney Generalâ€™s office.
Sincerely,
[Your Signature]
