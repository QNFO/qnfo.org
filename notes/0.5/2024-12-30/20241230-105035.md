Your problem is you’re messing up cause and effect in your mind and then using that as an excuse for your actions. For example, why is this the first time I’ve heard of this and why was it necessary to sneak in and take almost all of your stuff when we agreed you could keep it there? That doesn’t make sense. Your pathological lying may be getting you in trouble because you were not looking cute the last couple times I’ve seen you. It’s okay to be wrong. I’m frequently wrong and that’s why I appreciate that you gave me some feedback, although the more I think about it, the less informative it really is.
