Headline: AI for Good: Build a Co-Living Community & Change the World (San Francisco)
Body:
Are you an AI expert, social entrepreneur, or passionate changemaker who dreams of making a real difference in the world? Do you believe in the power of community and collaborative living?
[Your Name/Your Nonprofit Name] is seeking like-minded individuals to join us in creating a co-living space in San Francisco dedicated to developing and deploying AI solutions for social good. We’re building a team of 4-6 individuals to live and work together, combining our skills and passion to create impactful change.
Focus on Impact, Not Income:
This is not about getting rich. This is about using our collective skills and passion to make a positive impact on the world. We’re prioritizing individuals who are driven by purpose and who believe in the power of collaboration.
Two Options:
 - Co-living: Ideally, we’ll secure a house in San Francisco where we can live and work together, fostering a strong sense of community and collaboration.
 - Co-working: If co-living isn’t feasible for everyone, we’re open to exploring shared office spaces in San Francisco to maintain the in-person collaborative element.
Financial Considerations:
 - Office space will be provided.
 - We’ll explore revenue-sharing or other incentive structures to support team members.
 - Grant funding and stipends may be available.
Tell Us About Yourself:
We’re more interested in your skills, experience, and passion than your financial expectations. Tell us how you see yourself contributing to this collective and what unique value you bring to the table.
If this resonates with you, please get in touch! We’d love to connect and explore the possibilities together.
