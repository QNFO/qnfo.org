Existence is a nonlinear sequence. It is one both of order and seeming chaos as these sequences, these threads of sequence weave in and out with other aspects and other threads. We are born, we grow, we age, and we die, sometimes alone, sometimes with others. This is the tapestry of existence. It is not a rectangular grid of weft and warp. It is a tight bundle of joy, and is sometimes threadbare. What tapestry will you weave?
