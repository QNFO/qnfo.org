Hereâ€™s an idea. Just like ride-sharing limescooters have restrictions like speed restrictions and automatic stop if you enter a geofence zone, every vehicle sold in the United States, as of a certain date, must have the exact same features. So at any time law enforcement or if you enter a restricted zone, immediately cuts the engine automatically.
