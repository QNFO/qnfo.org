The Qmuni housing collective may be in Tucson, so Andy’s friend, Jason Webb, works for a housing nonprofit based in Tucson. So we’re going to initiate communication about my tenured AARP and the livability index and also the housing collective and empowering change to see what synergy there may be to start this intentional community there. So donating rent to the house of subprime carcasses that may still be around in overbuilt areas the bank could get a custodian to watch the place and they would get free rent and the bank could take a tax deduction on empowering changes dime.
