With over two decades of experience at the intersection of information, technology, and society, Rowan brings a unique perspective to the challenges and opportunities of the digital age.

Born Bradley James Gudzinas, Rowan’s early life was marked by a profound curiosity about the world and a deep awareness of the power of information – and the consequences of its absence. These formative experiences ignited a lifelong passion for understanding how knowledge is created, shared, and used to shape our world.

Rowan’s professional journey has been as diverse as it is impactful. He has led and managed multi-million dollar projects for organizations like AARP, where he oversaw the development of the Livability Index, and directed the $10 million National Household Travel Survey. His expertise in data analytics, AI, and blockchain technology has been instrumental in developing innovative solutions for a range of clients, from startups to Fortune 500 companies.

But Rowan’s work extends beyond the confines of traditional corporate and governmental roles. He is a dedicated entrepreneur, driven by a desire to leverage technology for the greater good. He is the founder of several groundbreaking initiatives, including:

-   **AI 411:** An ambitious project aiming to create a globally accessible, AI-powered information service via SMS, built on a foundation of distributed blockchain technology.
-   **Quantum Network Framework (QNF):** A research initiative focused on exploring the potential of quantum physics to push beyond our existing technological and conceptual limitations. This project delves into areas like quantum computing, communication, and sensing to develop new models for understanding and interacting with the universe.
-   **TruthAMP:** An innovative AI-powered application designed to empower individuals to process and share their personal narratives, fostering self-reflection, resilience, and healing.
-   **Qmuni:** A forward-thinking initiative exploring a co-living and shared-help model of community and support.
-   **QNFO:** This umbrella term encompasses Rowan’s broader thought leadership, including his writings, personal reflections, and philosophical inquiries into the nature of reality, consciousness, and the ethical implications of technology.

These projects reflect Rowan’s commitment to ethical innovation, social impact, and his belief in the power of information to transform lives.

Rowan’s intellectual pursuits are not confined to the practical realm. He is a prolific writer and thinker, exploring the profound philosophical implications of our evolving relationship with information. His book, “The Information Spectrum: Understanding Knowledge, Ignorance, and Everything In Between,” is a culmination of his years of experience and reflection, offering a comprehensive framework for navigating the complexities of the information age.

In 2024, after a period of personal exploration and self-discovery, he embraced the name Rowan Brad Quni, a change that reflects his evolving understanding of identity and his commitment to living authentically.

Today, Rowan is building a location-independent lifestyle, driven by a desire to contribute to the global community while exploring the world.
