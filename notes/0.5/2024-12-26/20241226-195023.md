 The big bang would seem to violate conservation of energy principle because where did the energy for it come from? Where did it start? So that violates the supremacy of the physical universe.

> The Big Bang doesn’t necessarily violate the conservation of energy, though it’s a complex issue that pushes the boundaries of our understanding of physics. Here’s why:
> - **Conservation of energy applies within the universe:** The law of conservation of energy, as we understand it, applies *within* the universe. It states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. The Big Bang represents the very beginning of spacetime as we know it. Asking where the energy came from *before* the Big Bang is like asking what’s north of the North Pole – the question itself may be based on a flawed premise. Our current models of physics break down at the singularity of the Big Bang, so we can’t extrapolate backwards with certainty.
> - **Zero-energy universe hypothesis:** One hypothesis suggests that the universe could have a total energy of zero. This seemingly paradoxical idea arises because gravitational energy is considered negative, while other forms of energy (like matter and radiation) are positive. It’s possible that the positive energy of the universe’s contents is perfectly balanced by the negative gravitational energy, resulting in a net energy of zero. If this is true, then no “new” energy was created in the Big Bang.
> - **Quantum fluctuations:** Quantum mechanics allows for the spontaneous appearance and disappearance of particles and energy, even in a vacuum. It’s theorized that the universe could have originated from a quantum fluctuation of immense scale. While this doesn’t fully explain the origin of the laws governing these fluctuations, it offers a potential mechanism for the universe to arise from a state with seemingly no energy.
> - **We don’t have a complete picture:** It’s crucial to acknowledge that our understanding of the very early universe is incomplete. We lack a theory of quantum gravity that can successfully unify general relativity (which describes gravity) and quantum mechanics (which describes the other fundamental forces). Such a theory is likely necessary to fully understand the Big Bang and the origin of the universe’s energy.
> - **“Supremacy of the physical universe”:** The idea of the Big Bang challenging the “supremacy of the physical universe” is a philosophical interpretation, not a scientific one. Science focuses on describing and explaining observable phenomena. Questions about the ultimate origin of existence and whether something exists “outside” the physical universe delve into metaphysics and are beyond the current scope of scientific inquiry.
> In summary, while the origin of the universe’s energy remains a mystery, the Big Bang doesn’t necessarily violate the conservation of energy as we understand it. It highlights the limitations of our current physical theories and motivates the search for a more complete understanding of the universe’s beginnings.
