I’m just saying this now by text because I think it may be important for you to discuss your mental well-being with your doctor since you seem not to be doing much about it except more discretionary drugs. I’m not confident that you’re willing to look far enough beyond yourself and niceties for this relationship. I also think you may have some version of bipolar disorder or manic depression given the laughter and the crying seem to occur at random. And/or some form of unresolved anger management issue, and you know I know what I’m talking about there. And I can’t help you when the nagging voice in my head keeps saying either I’m holding myself back and/or I’m going to have my feelings hurt (again). And I’m kinda depressed to txt this rn, but I also want to make sure that you have the support system you need whether I’m around or not. And that doesn’t mean changing our affection for each other, but it does mean that I owe it to myself to find pleasure in traveling again. You inspired that. And yet I definitely keep getting the nagging suspicion you’re not interested in seeing the rest of this glorious world of ours.
