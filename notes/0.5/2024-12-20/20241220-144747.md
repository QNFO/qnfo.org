I have a seven-week-old puppy who is continuing to urinate and defecate outside. He has not potty trained, and so I’m not sure how to do it, because when I put him on his potty pads or try to take him outside, he isn’t necessarily using it, and so I’m not sure how to reinforce proper behavior.

> It’s completely normal for a seven-week-old puppy to not be potty trained. At that age, their bladder and bowel control is still developing, and they simply lack the physical ability to hold it for long periods. Trying to force potty training at this age is likely to be frustrating for both you and the puppy.
> Here’s a more appropriate approach focusing on management and setting your puppy up for success rather than strict training:
> **1. Frequent Potty Breaks:** This is the KEY at this age. A seven-week-old puppy needs to go out *very* frequently. Aim for:
> - **Immediately after waking up:** Even if it’s just a short nap.
> - **After every meal or snack:** Digestion stimulates bowel movements.
> - **After playtime:** Excitement can trigger urination or defecation.
> - **Before bedtime:** A final potty break is crucial.
> - **Every 1-2 hours during the day:** This is a minimum, and you may need to go even more often.
> **2. Supervise Constantly:** Keep a close eye on your puppy. Watch for signs they need to go, such as:
> - **Restlessness:** Pacing, whining, sniffing the floor.
> - **Squatting:** Obvious sign they’re about to eliminate.
> - **Circling:** Another common precursor.
> The moment you see any of these signs, immediately grab your puppy and rush them outside to their designated potty spot.
> **3. Positive Reinforcement:** When your puppy eliminates *outside* in the designated spot, immediately praise them enthusiastically with a happy voice, a treat (tiny pieces!), and/or a favorite toy. The timing is crucial – praise *immediately* after they finish.
> **4. Minimize Accidents:** Accidents are inevitable at this age. Don’t punish your puppy for them; it will only create fear and anxiety, hindering the training process. Instead, thoroughly clean up accidents with an enzymatic cleaner (to remove the scent and discourage repeat offenses).
> **5. Potty Pads – Use Cautiously:** Potty pads can be helpful *in conjunction with* outdoor training, but they shouldn’t be the sole focus. Many puppies get confused and prefer the pads to going outside. If you use them, place them in a designated area and gradually move them closer to the door leading outside. The ultimate goal is outdoor elimination.
> **6. Crate Training (Optional but Helpful):** A crate can be a valuable tool for potty training. Puppies instinctively avoid soiling their den. The crate should be just large enough for them to stand, turn around, and lie down comfortably. Never use the crate as punishment.
> **7. Patience and Consistency:** Potty training takes time and patience. Don’t get discouraged by setbacks. Consistency in your routine and positive reinforcement are key to success.
> **8. Vet Check:** If your puppy is having significantly more accidents than expected, or shows signs of discomfort while urinating or defecating, consult your veterinarian. There could be an underlying medical issue.
> At seven weeks old, focus on frequent potty breaks, constant supervision, and positive reinforcement. Formal training techniques are more effective when the puppy has better bladder control, which will develop over the next few weeks.
