Greetings. I run a non-profit called Empowering Change started to holisticly address substance use harm reduction in the queer community. With the benefit of listening and learning and evolving best practices in our first year we’re looking to start a house and looking for guidance. Our values and initial operating plan are in the link. Ideally I’d connect with a realtor to help me select a 3-4 bed rental for immediate occupancy while recruiting other interested occupants. https://qnfo.org/Files/By+Name/Qmuni/Empowering+Change+Qmuni+%E2%80%93+Pilot+Program+Prospectus
