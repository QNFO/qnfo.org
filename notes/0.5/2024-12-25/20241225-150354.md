People are not kind here. There’s little interest in building community beyond one’s own self-interest. And the rules apply not to me. Furthermore, I entitle myself to judge others with the ultimate hypocrisy, claiming to be “open-minded” and “progressive” while actually revealing that the only thing that matters to me is myself, my own selfish reality.
