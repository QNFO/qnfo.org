If I understand non-profit fundraising you create tiers of donors so maybe six or seven tiers of gift amounts and so like well-placed family and friends shake down first and say hey if you’ll commit a thousand dollars you only have to give that once we reach our goal and then use that to leverage Lower brackets. Hey, we’ve already committed $50,000 toward our goal. How about you match that? Or how about you donate and we can get that matched? Grants administration sounds like too much overhead, but you do what you have to.
