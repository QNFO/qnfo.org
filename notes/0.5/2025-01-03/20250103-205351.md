Ketamine is to brain activation and higher levels of consciousness as what else?

> [!ai]+ AI

> This analogy prompts us to think of something that relates to a *different* system in the body in the same way ketamine relates to the brain and consciousness. Ketamine increases brain activity and elevates (or alters) consciousness. So we’re looking for something that:
> - **Acts on a specific organ or system.**
> - **Increases activity or function of that system.**
> Here are a few possibilities, with varying degrees of fit:
> - **Adrenaline/Epinephrine is to the sympathetic nervous system and heightened alertness/fight-or-flight response.** This is probably the closest analogy. Adrenaline acts on the sympathetic nervous system, increasing heart rate, blood pressure, and overall alertness, similar to how ketamine acts on the brain.
> - **Caffeine is to the central nervous system and wakefulness.** Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system, promoting wakefulness and reducing fatigue.
> - **Insulin is to the pancreas and glucose regulation/cellular uptake.** Insulin increases the activity of glucose transporters, facilitating the uptake of glucose from the blood into cells. This is a slightly weaker analogy as it’s about regulating a process rather than simply increasing overall activity.
> - **A defibrillator is to the heart and restored heart rhythm.** A defibrillator delivers an electrical shock to the heart, restoring a normal heart rhythm in cases of cardiac arrest. This is less about increasing baseline activity and more about restoring function.
> - **Exercise is to muscles and strength/growth.** Exercise increases muscle activity, leading to increased strength and growth over time. This is a broader analogy, but still captures the idea of increased activity leading to a change in state.
> The best analogy depends on what specific aspect of ketamine’s action you want to emphasize. If it’s the increased activity and altered state of consciousness, adrenaline is likely the closest parallel. If it’s the restoration of function (in some cases ketamine is used for depression), the defibrillator analogy might be more appropriate.
