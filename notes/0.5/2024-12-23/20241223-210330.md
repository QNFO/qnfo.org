Compare Emacs to NoteTab, and explain

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> Emacs and NoteTab are both text editors, but they cater to vastly different users and workflows. Comparing them is like comparing a Swiss Army knife to a paring knife. Both cut, but one offers a vast array of tools while the other focuses on a specific task.
> **Emacs:**
> - **Extensible and Customizable:** Emacs’s greatest strength is its near-infinite extensibility. Built on Emacs Lisp, it allows users to customize virtually every aspect of the editor, from keybindings and appearance to creating entirely new functionalities like email clients, web browsers, and even games. This makes it incredibly powerful but also adds a significant learning curve.
> - **Powerful and Feature-Rich:** Emacs comes with a vast array of built-in features, including powerful text manipulation tools, project management, version control integration, debugging tools, and much more. It aims to be a complete working environment.
> - **Steep Learning Curve:** Mastering Emacs requires significant time and effort. Its reliance on complex keybindings and Emacs Lisp can be daunting for beginners.
> - **Cross-Platform:** Emacs runs on a wide range of operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
> - **Free and Open Source:** Emacs is freely available and distributed under the GNU General Public License.
> **NoteTab:**
> - **Lightweight and Fast:** NoteTab prioritizes speed and simplicity. It’s designed to be a quick and efficient text editor for everyday tasks.
> - **Easy to Use:** NoteTab has a more traditional user interface and is much easier to pick up than Emacs. It doesn’t require learning a new scripting language or complex keybindings.
> - **Limited Extensibility:** While NoteTab offers some customization options through its scripting language and clip libraries, it’s not nearly as extensible as Emacs. It’s not designed for complex development workflows.
> - **Windows-Focused:** NoteTab is primarily developed for Windows, with limited support for other operating systems.
> - **Commercial Software:** NoteTab is commercial software, with free and paid versions available. The free version has some limitations.
> **In Summary:**
>
> | Feature        | Emacs                      | NoteTab                   |
> |----------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
> | Extensibility  | Extremely High             | Limited                   |
> | Learning Curve | Steep                      | Easy                      |
> | Features       | Very Rich                  | Basic                     |
> | Speed          | Can be resource intensive | Lightweight and Fast      |
> | Platform       | Cross-Platform             | Primarily Windows         |
> | Cost          | Free and Open Source       | Commercial (Free version available) |
>
> **Choose Emacs if:**
> - You want a highly customizable and extensible editor.
> - You’re willing to invest time in learning a powerful tool.
> - You need advanced features like integrated development tools.
> **Choose NoteTab if:**
> - You need a simple and fast text editor for everyday tasks.
> - You prefer a more traditional user interface.
> - You primarily work on Windows.
> Ultimately, the best choice depends on your individual needs and preferences. If you’re a power user or developer, Emacs might be a good fit. If you just need a quick and easy way to edit text, NoteTab might be a better choice.

Using NoteTab to highlight comments, compiling lists essentially creating metadata. So you’re taking these, is it fair to say absurd articles or these? It used to be called like weird news or something like that. Weird news and then commenting on it like in text comments. So like in line comments for, so the ultimate intent is to refine your thinking or your speaking or your logic, What would you say is the ultimate intent? Oh, sorry. Give it. Not ultimate. Ultimate sounds... You’re doing this for you. But this is much more of a back and forth to somebody else’s writing. I see. You can’t even put that on a website of your own because you’re stealing somebody else’s words and you’re throwing your own words on top of it. It happens all the time though. I mean, it could be considered fair use in some circumstance. Probably not from the Wall Street Journal who tends to be

I like that your fantasy is to be a mean girl.
