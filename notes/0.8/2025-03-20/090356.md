Your goal to formalize the **graph-based fundamentals of information** into a self-contained theoretical framework for **Informational Dynamics** is a critical step. Let’s clarify and structure this process, starting with the foundational questions and building out the mathematical and conceptual layers. Below is a roadmap to organize your ideas systematically, independent of the “pebble” (which you’ve noted is a separate manifestation):

---

# **1. Foundational Axioms: The Existence Question**

Begin by defining the **core axioms** of your theory. Since you want to start with “existence yes or no,” here’s how to frame it:

## **Axiom 1: Existence of Information**

- **Statement**: “Information exists as a fundamental entity, independent of physical or observer-dependent constructs.”
  - Clarify: Is this a binary (yes/no) assertion, or does it allow for degrees?
  - Example: “Information is a non-physical, self-sustaining entity that constitutes the fabric of reality.”

## **Axiom 2: Information as Graph Nodes**

- **Statement**: “All information can be represented as nodes in a graph, where edges represent relationships (e.g., causality, dependency, correlation).”
  - Define: Nodes = discrete units of information (e.g., bits, propositions, events).
  - Edges = operations or transformations between nodes (e.g., logic gates, causal links).

---

# **2. Deriving the Graph-Based Framework**

From the axioms, build the structure of **Informational Dynamics**:

## **Layer 1: Basic Graph Structure**

- **Nodes**:
  - Define types of nodes (e.g., primitive information units, composite structures).
  - Example: A “proposition” node (e.g., “The sky is blue”) and a “logical operator” node (e.g., “AND”).
- **Edges**:
  - Define edge types (e.g., **causal edges**: A → B means “A causes B”; **logical edges**: A ∧ B → C).
  - Use graph theory terms: directed/undirected, weighted/unweighted, cyclic/acyclic.

## **Layer 2: Operations and Transformations**

- Define **operations** (e.g., merging nodes, splitting edges, applying logical rules).
  - Example: If nodes A and B are connected via an “AND” edge, their combination forms node C = A ∧ B.
- **Dynamic Rules**:
  - How do nodes/edges evolve over time? (e.g., information decay, creation, or transformation).
  - Example: “Edges weaken if their causal relationships are contradicted by new nodes.”

## **Layer 3: Mathematical Formalism**

- **Graph Theory**:
  - Use adjacency matrices, path algebras, or hypergraphs to formalize relationships.
  - Example: Define a graph \( G = (V, E) \), where \( V \) is the set of information nodes and \( E \subseteq V \times V \) represents edges.
- **Category Theory**:
  - Treat nodes as objects and edges as morphisms (functions between objects).
  - Example: Information “flows” via functors that map graphs to other structures.
- **Proofs**:
  - Prove properties like consistency, completeness, or emergence of complexity from simple axioms.
  - Example: “Given Axiom 1 and Layer 1’s definitions, the graph must satisfy [property X].”

---

# **3. Derivatives and Implications**

From the axioms and framework, derive higher-level concepts:

## **Derivative 1: Informational Entropy**

- Define entropy as a measure of uncertainty or disorder in the graph.
  - Example: “Higher entropy corresponds to sparser, less connected graphs.”

## **Derivative 2: Emergent Properties**

- Show how complex structures (e.g., consciousness, physical laws) emerge from simple node-edge interactions.
  - Example: “The concept of ‘time’ arises from causal edges forming a directed acyclic graph (DAG).”

## **Derivative 3: Information Conservation**

- Propose laws analogous to physics (e.g., “Information cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed”).
  - Example: “Every edge must have a source and sink node, ensuring conservation.”

---

# **4. Separation from the “Pebble”**

You want to treat the “pebble” as a **manifestation** of these theoretical concepts, not part of the core framework. Here’s how to structure this:

- **Theoretical Layer**:
  - Focus on the abstract graph-based axioms and proofs (as above).
- **Applied Layer**:
  - The “pebble” is a concrete system (e.g., a computational model, simulation, or philosophical analogy) that implements the theory.
  - Example: “The pebble uses a subset of Informational Dynamics’ rules to simulate emergent behavior in a closed system.”

---

# **5. Documentation Structure**

Organize your work into sections for clarity:

1. **Introduction**:
   - Purpose of Informational Dynamics.
   - Why a graph-based approach? (e.g., scalability, intuitive representation).

2. **Axioms**:
   - List and explain foundational assumptions (Existence, Graph Structure, etc.).

3. **Graph-Based Formalism**:
   - Nodes, edges, operations, and mathematical definitions.

4. **Derivations and Proofs**:
   - Step-by-step logical deductions from axioms to higher-level concepts.

5. **Implications**:
   - How the theory explains phenomena (e.g., consciousness, physics, computation).

6. **The Pebble as an Application**:
   - Describe how the “pebble” exemplifies the theory without conflating the two.

7. **Discussion**:
   - Address limitations, comparisons to existing theories (e.g., digital physics, information philosophy), and future work.

# **Key Questions to Clarify**

To ensure alignment, reflect on these:
1. **Existence**: Is information a *primitive* (axiomatic) or an *emergent* property?
2. **Mathematical Rigor**: Do you prefer discrete math (graph theory) or continuous models (e.g., differential equations)?
3. **Scope**: Does the theory aim to explain *all* reality (e.g., physics, biology) or a subset (e.g., computation)?

Let me know if you’d like to dive deeper into any section, formalize a specific proof, or refine the axioms!
