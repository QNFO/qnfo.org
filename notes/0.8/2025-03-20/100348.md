A theory of everything must start with the first thing: existence. Rather than in trying to explain such complex phenomenon as black holes, the big bang, biologic systems, and Galaxy rotations it is helpful to start from basics not create ever more complex theories based on existing flawed work--which is prima facie flawed because it can’t explain everything: the set of all sets including the null set that does not contain the set of all sets. We can all acknowledge existence because we all acknowledge that we do exist as well as acknowledge things like the initial existence of our universe or even its continued existence. I think therefore I am as descarte said so let’s start there.
