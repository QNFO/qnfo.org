And one point 1.3 the challenge of understanding information would seem to tie into the challenge of explaining it or understanding it through our measurement constructs noting that our constructs like math are entirely our own framework for trying to make sense of things there are different ways of doing this which aren’t really going worth going into but what we consider math as an empirical framework is not a universal given that that’s entirely human created. And so as in any system trying to explain itself per Godel we have to grapple with that how to how to use something like math and formalisms to explain itself given things like the inconsistencies with zero and and our ratio level number line when the universe doesn’t work like that the universe is nonlinear but those are not but this paper will not go into those things other than to mention that it’s something we should consider even as we attempt to formalize these this framework this Theory mathematically
