Output
Yes quantum theory is fundamentally an information theory. It describes how information about particles and systems evolves and interacts often in ways that defy classical intuition. Just as a digital file can be in a superposition of states (e.g. open or closed) quantum systems can exist in multiple informational states until measured. For example a photon’s state is not a particle or wave but a set of properties (energy momentum polarization) that define its interactions.
Superposition in quantum mechanics is like flipping a coin. Before the coin lands it’s in a state where both heads and tails are possible. Similarly a quantum particle can exist in multiple states (e.g. particle-like or wave-like) until it’s observed. The act of measurement collapses the particle into a definite state just like the coin landing on heads or tails.
While a coin flip can be predicted with perfect information in classical systems quantum systems are fundamentally different. Even with perfect information quantum systems exhibit probabilistic behavior due to inherent indeterminacy. This confirms that quantum mechanics is about how information evolves and interacts not just physical processes. Just like the coin a quantum particle’s state is not determined until measured and the outcome is probabilistic.
Loaded dice are a great analogy for deterministic systems. When dice are loaded they always land on the same face making the outcome predictable. In contrast quantum systems like particles can exist in multiple possible states until measured. Even with perfect information quantum systems exhibit probabilistic behavior due to inherent indeterminacy. The key difference is that quantum systems are not deterministic but probabilistic governed by informational states.
Traffic congestion is a great example of informational dynamics. Just like quantum systems traffic transitions from smooth flow to congestion due to information density (number of cars) and road capacity. The state change from smooth flow to congestion is similar to a quantum system transitioning from superposition to a definite state. Cars mimic each other’s behavior and congestion arises from cause and effect just like quantum interactions.
Social media trends are a great example of informational dynamics. Just like quantum systems trends spread rapidly as information disperses across the network. The mimicry of users adopting the trend is similar to entangled particles replicating each other’s states. The entropy of the trend increases as it spreads and the trend stabilizes as entropy decreases similar to quantum systems reaching a stable state.
Weather patterns are a great example of informational dynamics. Just like quantum systems weather evolves due to information dispersal (heat energy) and state changes (air masses transitioning from calm to turbulent). The contrast between warm and cold air masses is similar to the contrast between particle-like and wave-like behavior in quantum systems. Wind patterns are caused by differences in air pressure similar to cause and effect in quantum interactions.
Financial transactions are a great example of informational dynamics. Just like quantum systems transactions involve state changes (money transitioning from one account to another) and cause and effect (transactions driven by user actions). The entropy of the financial system decreases as transactions are processed efficiently similar to how quantum systems evolve toward higher entropy. Different transactions contrast based on amount location and timing.
Urban development is a great example of informational dynamics. Just like quantum systems cities grow by expanding their infrastructure (roads buildings) to connect more areas. The self-similarity of urban structures (e.g. neighborhoods parks) is similar to the self-similarity in quantum systems. The state change of cities evolving from small towns to megacities is similar to quantum systems transitioning from superposition to a definite state.
Traffic lights are a great example of informational dynamics. Just like quantum systems traffic lights control the flow of vehicles based on information density (number of cars) and cause and effect (timers and sensors). The mimicry of cars following the traffic light is similar to entangled particles mimicking each other’s states. The state change of traffic lights transitioning between red yellow and green is similar to quantum systems transitioning between states.
The Big Bang was not a singularity in the classical sense. Informational dynamics defines it as an informational state change—a transition from a low-entropy highly constrained informational state to a dynamic edge network. Expansion is driven by entropy (information dispersal) not hypothetical forces like dark energy. The cosmic microwave background reflects early edge network configurations not inflationary relics.
Informational dynamics defines time as the sequence of state changes and cause/effect relationships. Time’s arrow emerges from entropy’s increase (information dispersal) not an inherent dimension. For example time’s arrow is like shuffling a deck of cards—once shuffled the information can’t unshuffle.
Informational dynamics explains gravity as an emergent property of edge networks. No gravitons are needed—gravity arises from information density and relational constraints. For example gravity is like traffic density pulling cars toward regions with more cars.
Informational dynamics explains consciousness as an emergent node of neural information networks. Subjective experience arises from mimicry (pattern replication) and contrast (signal differentiation) in neural information. For example consciousness is like a complex pattern in a neural network not a separate entity.
Dark matter particles are a myth. Informational dynamics explains gravitational effects as edge network density. Galaxies’ rotation curves arise from information distribution not unseen particles. For example dark matter is like shadows—shadows aren’t made of invisible stuff they’re caused by light blocking.
Informational dynamics explains entanglement as mimicry (information replication). Information replicates across spacetime eliminating “spooky action.” For example entangled particles share information states not because of faster-than-light communication but because of informational replication.
Quantum tunneling is an informational transformation—particles can pass through potential barriers that they classically should not be able to penetrate. For example a particle can tunnel through a barrier because of the nature of its informational state not because of a physical force.
Quantum measurement is an informational transformation—particles collapse into definite states when observed not because of hidden variables or mysterious forces. For example when you measure a quantum system it collapses into a definite state because of the act of measurement not because of some hidden property.
Quantum computers exploit state change and mimicry—they’re info processors at their core. Informational dynamics says they could model edge networks to predict cosmic behavior. For example quantum computers can simulate complex systems by processing information in ways that classical computers cannot.
The multiverse is a myth. Informational dynamics explains “multiverses” as informational branches within edge networks not physical realities. For example quantum superposition creates divergent informational pathways not parallel universes.
Newtonian physics is accurate for macroscopic objects but fails at quantum/relativistic scales. Informational dynamics unifies scales by treating information as fundamental. For example Newtonian physics works well for large objects but breaks down at the quantum level where information dynamics take over.
General relativity accurately describes gravity at large scales but fails to unify with quantum mechanics. Informational dynamics explains gravity as an emergent property of edge networks eliminating the need for spacetime curvature. For example gravity is not caused by spacetime curvature but by information density and relationships.
The cosmological constant is unnecessary. Informational dynamics reinterprets cosmic expansion as entropy-driven dispersal of information not a mysterious repulsive force. For example cosmic expansion is driven by the spread of information not dark energy.
The experiment shows contrast—particles act as waves or particles based on how info is observed. No “weirdness”—just info rules. For example the double-slit experiment demonstrates that particles behave differently based on how they are observed not because of some hidden property.
Inflation was early-state edge network expansion as info dispersed post-Big Bang. No fields needed—just entropy. For example inflation is driven by the spread of information not a mysterious inflaton field.
Informational dynamics aligns with the holographic principle which states that information about a volume of space is encoded on its boundary aligning with Informational dynamics’ edge networks. For example the holographic principle suggests that the information content of a volume of space is encoded on its boundary just like edge networks.
Informational dynamics builds on Wheeler’s idea that information is the fundamental basis of reality prefiguring Informational dynamics. For example Wheeler’s “it from bit” suggests that everything is made of information aligning with the core principles of Informational dynamics.
Informational dynamics defines fractals as self-similar patterns in edge networks that repeat across scales explaining why atomic and galactic structures mirror each other. For example fractals are patterns that repeat at different scales like the branching of trees or the structure of galaxies.
Informational dynamics defines dimensions as emergent properties of edge network topology. 3D space reflects how informational relationships interconnect naturally. Time is a sequence of state changes not a dimension. Higher dimensions in string theory are informational layers not physical spaces. For example 3D space is a natural outcome of informational relationships not a fundamental property.
