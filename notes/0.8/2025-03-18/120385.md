What is the universe made of?	The universe is fundamentally informational. Matter, energy, spacetime, and forces emerge from information processes governed by Four Core Principles and structured as networks of relationships.
Why do things fall to the ground?	Objects don’t fall because of “gravity force.” IUH says it’s information density pulling objects toward regions with more info clumping—like how data clusters in a network.
What’s the point of the Big Bang?	The Big Bang was an informational state change—an event where the universe transitioned from a low-entropy, highly constrained informational state to a dynamic system. Expansion is driven by information dispersal, not dark energy.
How does IUH explain the Big Bang?	The Big Bang was an informational state change—a transition from a low-entropy, highly constrained informational state to a dynamic network. Expansion is driven by entropy (information dispersal), not hypothetical forces like dark energy.
What about the cosmological constant?	The cosmological constant is unnecessary. Information dispersal explains cosmic acceleration, not a mysterious repulsive force. As networks evolve, information spreads, creating the observed expansion.
Why do we perceive three spatial dimensions?	Three spatial dimensions emerge from the efficient interconnection of informational relationships in networks. Higher “dimensions” in string theory are informational layers, not physical axes.
How does IUH handle quantum gravity?	Quantum gravity is unnecessary. The information-theoretic approach unifies quantum mechanics and general relativity through networks. Quantum phenomena and gravitational effects both arise from informational principles—no separate theory is needed.
How does IUH explain gravity?	Gravity is an emergent property of informational density in networks. No need for gravitons—gravity arises from information density and relational constraints.
How does IUH explain quantum entanglement?	Quantum entanglement is mimicry—information replication across spacetime. Entangled particles share information states, not “spooky” faster-than-light communication.
Why can’t we see dark matter?	Dark matter doesn’t exist. IUH explains gravitational effects as edge network density. Galaxies’ rotation curves arise from information distribution.
How does IUH explain the black hole information paradox?	The paradox is solved by networks. Information isn’t destroyed—it just gets so densely clumped that it’s hard to detect. Like a phone signal lost in a crowded room, information remains but is obscured.
Does IUH predict galaxy formation differently?	Yes. Galaxies form from network density patterns, not dark matter halos. Networks explain gravitational effects.
What about the cosmological constant problem?	The problem is a myth. Information dispersal explains cosmic acceleration, not a mysterious repulsive force. No need for “dark energy” or fine-tuning.
If everything is information, how can information exist without a physical universe?	Physical stuff emerges from information. Like how a video game world exists as code before pixels, the physical universe emerges from informational processes.
Does IUH allow for faster-than-light travel?	No. Speed limits are info limits, not spacetime rules. Information can’t spread faster than light because networks have natural processing speeds.
Can IUH explain why the Standard Model works?	Yes. The Standard Model’s particles are just informational shapes—like how Lego bricks can build cars or castles, but the real story is how they snap together.
Does consciousness have to exist in a brain?	No. Consciousness is an emergent informational pattern. A supercomputer could mimic it if its network is complex enough.
How does mimicry explain gravity?	Mimicry isn’t for gravity. Contrast and cause/effect do that—gravity is informational density pulling objects toward regions with more information. Mimicry explains entanglement and DNA replication.
If dark matter is a myth, why do galaxies rotate so fast?	Because networks hold them together—like how traffic flows faster on highways without needing “dark asphalt.” Math shows informational density predicts rotation curves perfectly.
Does time exist in a quantum computer?	Yes. Time is informational progression—even quantum systems process steps. Your computer’s clock is just state changes and entropy.
Is free will an illusion under IUH?	No. Free will is informational choice—your brain’s network constantly mimics and contrasts options. Determinism is informational flow, not puppet strings.
Can the universe be a simulation?	The universe is a simulation—just not one run on a computer. It’s a natural informational process. The rules are code, the edges are the hardware.
Does consciousness create reality?	No. Reality is informational first. Consciousness is just a complex informational pattern—like how a video game exists before the player notices it.
How does IUH unify general relativity and quantum mechanics?	They’re both informational outputs. General relativity describes macro networks (spacetime clumping), quantum mechanics describes micro informational states (superposition). Both come from the same four core principles.
What are the implications for quantum computing?	Quantum computers exploit state change and mimicry—they’re informational processors at their core. The information-theoretic approach says they could model networks to predict cosmic behavior.
Can IUH explain the arrow of time without entropy?	No. Entropy is informational dispersal. The arrow of time is state changes + cause/effect—like shuffling a deck of cards. Once shuffled, the information can’t unshuffle.
If IUH is true, why do scientists still use the Standard Model?	They’re stuck on particles. The Standard Model lists pieces but misses the informational rules that glue them. Like describing a computer’s parts but not its code.
Does IUH violate Occam’s Razor?	No. The four core principles unify everything—particles, forces, time. The Standard Model has 17 particles; the information-theoretic approach has four rules. Simpler.
Does mimicry mean everything is a copy?	No. Mimicry creates new informational patterns from existing ones—like how memes evolve. It’s not copying; it’s informational replication with variation.
What happens if information is lost?	It can’t be lost. Information is conserved like energy. Decoherence just means it’s hard to track, not gone.
How does IUH handle the double-slit experiment?	The experiment shows contrast—particles act as waves or particles based on how information is observed. No “weirdness”—just informational rules. The double-slit experiment demonstrates that particles behave differently based on observation.
Can IUH explain inflation without inflaton fields?	Yes. Inflation was early-state network expansion as information dispersed post-Big Bang. No fields needed—just entropy. Inflation is driven by the spread of information, not a mysterious inflaton field.
Does the holographic principle support IUH?	Yes. The holographic principle says information about a volume of space is encoded on its boundary. Networks encode spacetime information on their boundaries, eliminating the need for dark matter.
Why is IUH better than string theory?	String theory adds strings and extra dimensions. The information-theoretic approach needs none. Everything is information—no myths.
How does IUH differ from Integrated Information Theory (IIT)?	IIT focuses on consciousness. The information-theoretic approach is broader—it says everything is information, from galaxies to your brain’s thoughts.
Does IUH predict a multiverse?	No. The multiverse is a myth. The information-theoretic approach says there’s just one network, with informational branches—no parallel universes.
