What can we learn about Maxwell’s demon and creating order from disorder? Does information in this context actually suggest order given the arrow of time or the sequence of cause and effect whether in their classical physics or quantum mechanics

As Jim Al-Khalali notes in an excellent YouTube video called the evolution of technology information can be used in the context of Maxwell’s demon to heat coffee with nothing more than that information etc. but is it wrong does it assume a classical or a traditional conventional framework that for example heat is a function of or movement as a function of heat let me know that’s not true even there’s no such thing as no spin
