# Is Mimicry “Consciousness”?

**The Real Fundamentals (Primitives) of Reality**

*Our constructs (“weak force” etc) are at best a model of something much more fundamental*

==Oh yeah this is going to be fun. So the post is going to be called. It’s going to is going to poke at the four four electromagnetic forces. The four real forces the real forces of reality and I’m not even going to use the word informational these are just. These are what shape reality State change which is also called sequence or time. Then there is contrast. They’re all changes essentially. Well no those two are changes right? One is a change in in property. Yeah I’ll have to think about that. One is a change in property. The others are changing in sequence in time. They’re different vectors so those are those would be lumped together. The third one is cause and effect okay so theirs and then the last. So then the first two might be called sort of they’re. They’re a different axis right? These are word dimensionalities so the first two get grouped together but those are different axes and the next two get grouped together. So cause and effect not every sequential change is a cause and effect relationship. Let’s keep in mind but then the really fun. One is mimicry + however we define that and maybe it’s just cause and effect. But now that’s cause and effect is not mimicry. So that’s a different dimension. And mimicry is definitely what we would call Consciousness but cause and effect is intent I see so cause and effect is intent and and somehow those two form what we call Consciousness or or sort of that like other because those two are not explainable by the physical Universe. That’s what’s interesting cause and effect you know are they? Maybe I’d have to look into that some more. Actually, now that I think about it, but the mimicry one is fascinating because two rocks will never mimic each other and so if we’re stuck in the physical Universe but does information mimic each other. No, I don’t think it does that. That must be something to do with consciousness because you will never get you know just as if we’re trying to all right. And that’s the point mimicry is where we start talking about how to communicate with aliens because then if we don’t because the only way we would know that anything in the cosmic background, radiation, whatever is through entangled States where one does the same thing. So so then that’s the cause and effect though. Okay. Entangled states aren’t mimicry except when well wait. No entangled States. Unless they are I don’t know. I think you need an intent to create the entang that’s that’s a key can. Can you happen to entangle particles randomly? No, I think it requires intent cause and effect so cause and effect then becomes a precursor to mimicry. But if I roll if I roll a rock down a hill or you know I smash Adams? Oh maybe that’s a good one. If I smash Adams together that’s cause of fact. But is it going to cause mimicry? No, I don’t think so. I don’t know and then furthermore, let’s take the humans out of it. Are there any examples we can think of mimic reoccurs as a purely random mutation may be genetics where cells divide, but that’s what we call life so there’s human. So let’s take what we’d consider life biology out of it. Although you can see there’s a wonderfully complex interrelationship here and this touch is exactly on what we’re talking about about the hard problem of Consciousness and so so much that’s still actually kind of hard to grapple with at the moment==
