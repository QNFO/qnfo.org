🌌 **Calling Collaborators: Let’s Redefine Reality Through Information & Bio-Inspired Quantum Systems** 🌌

If you’re obsessed with information as the fabric of existence or quantum computing inspired by biological systems, let’s connect! My work transcends traditional physics and focuses on:

✨ The Informational Universe Hypothesis
A framework where information—not particles or forces—underpins reality. This isn’t about the “four fundamental forces” but a systemic theory that reimagines the universe as an emergent informational construct.

🌱 Bio-Inspired Quantum Computing
Designing quantum systems that mimic biological processes (e.g., neural networks, evolutionary algorithms) to solve problems classical systems can’t touch.

💡 Why Collaborate?
These ideas could revolutionize how we approach AI, consciousness studies, and even the origins of complexity. Joining this work means contributing to a paradigm shift—your name will be tied to breakthroughs that challenge conventional science.

🔍 What I’m Looking For
- Researchers passionate about information theory, bio-inspired systems, or quantum foundations.
- Thinkers who’ve explored non-physical frameworks of reality (philosophy, systems theory, etc.).
- No “tasks”—just deep collaboration to expand these hypotheses.

📧 How to Start
1. Explore my research: qnfo.org (no paywalls, all ideas openly shared).
2. Email me (details on the site) with your vision or questions.
3. Let’s brainstorm how to test and propagate these ideas.

🚀 This is bigger than physics. It’s about rewriting the rules.
