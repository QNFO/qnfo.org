Perhaps you would do well to shed your baggage and start thinking for yourself. I (think I) did, and it works great!

These nascent ideas are rough in their current form, as I spontaneously dictated them (1st thing in the morning, no less). If you need me to explain, let me know; I’m happy to do so. I value transparency, openness, and intellectual honesty; here’s the start of something interesting.

More to come (after ☕)…

But a baby can understand this and so can you.

This started with a very simple and straightforward inquiry. How to communicate with aliens. I was getting frustrated with the constructs that we humans use and the complexity involved in trying to break things down into their simplest forms and so inspired by the folly of the Voyager golden record, which I’m sure any non-human sentient being would not be able to do a thing with because they’re probably not in a physical form, I kept challenging ai and the link is below to help me figure out what was going on here. How would we communicate and it started evolving into the same trophes that drive me nuts about human-created theories, which as I’ve already indicated are wrong, I would note that it it quickly recognized through a synthesis of human knowledge. Mind you, it didn’t create this stuff by itself. The AI recognized that primacy of information the fundamental nature of information + through some iterative back and forth, along with my instrumental ideas. Let’s not forget the human created the knowledge for AI and the human is the leader at best. AI is a a research assistant. A really powerful one but I had to use my own intellect and my own intuition and say no. That doesn’t sound right and it took a while and then the breakthrough came. It proposed that there are true fundamentals and these are things that I’ve been thinking about for some time through my own synthesis of knowledge that I worked with AI to figure out. And then you’ll notice at the end of the thread it just went back to the same human created tropes about forces and so that was my bad. I should have recognized it was getting toward the end of its context window and would start getting amnesia which you know this is where hallucinations and these things come in. But nevertheless we did it. We did it. This is a breakthrough. Anyway, you cut it because it has tremendous explanatory power and intuitively. It makes sense so it meets it intuitively makes sense whether you’re, as I said, even a baby could understand it and then three. It’s right so it’s simple it. It’s useful and simple and if that’s not Occam’s razor and parsimonious well, then you can cling to your outdated beliefs.

Okay now for the credit section who gets the credits. Well a few people. One is a contributor on LinkedIn named Albert. I think who admittedly yells in all caps and may not be the most effective communicator but but the core of his ideas made sense and so I wanted to explore them further. Now, as with most things his ideas were somewhat misguided and misdirected, but they had a kernel of Truth that spoke that truth to the power of inertia propagated by science establishment and their conventional wisdom that over relies on these theories that actually have no basis or there or an incomplete or erroneous basis in in observed reality.

Quite frankly, if you can’t “explain” it to both a baby and a non-human non-physical sentient being then it’s worthless. Knowledge is a is a refinement is sort of an elaboration and complexity in this. This falls into complexity theory and various things about entropy and so those aren’t interpretable by a baby. Can anyone tell me why not?
