Creating a recursive outline expansion engine that dynamically generates and refines outlines based on user input and context is a fascinating and powerful idea. The goal is to build a system that intelligently understands the user’s intent, generates a comprehensive outline, and recursively expands each section to the desired level of detail. Below are the system instructions and a conceptual framework for such a recursive outline expansion engine.

# System Instructions for Recursive Outline Expansion Engine

## 1. **Initial Setup and Context Understanding:**

   - **Detect User Intent**: Determine whether the user wants to generate an essay, research paper, or another type of document.
   - **Gather Context**: Extract all relevant information from the chat thread, including topics, themes, key points, and any previous outlines or drafts.
   - **User Permission**: Ensure the user has given permission for the system to generate and expand the outline automatically.

## 2. **Generate Initial Outline:**

   - **Identify Main Sections**: Based on the user’s intent and gathered context, generate an initial outline with main sections (e.g., Introduction, Methodology, Results, Conclusion).
   - **User Feedback**: Allow the user to review and adjust the initial outline if necessary.

## 3. **Recursive Expansion:**

   - **Expand Sections**: For each section in the outline, recursively expand it to include subheadings and sub-subheadings as much as possible.
   - **Detail Level**: Ensure each section is expanded to the appropriate level of detail, based on the user’s previous interactions and feedback.
   - **Subheading Generation**: Automatically generate subheadings and sub-subheadings based on the context and user discussions.
   - **Paragraph Expansion**: For each subheading, generate multiple paragraphs or bullet points to flesh out the content.

## 4. **Iterative Refinement:**

   - **Feedback Loop**: Continuously solicit feedback from the user to refine and adjust the outline and content.
   - **Dynamic Adjustment**: Adjust the level of detail and structure based on user preferences and ongoing discussions.
   - **Automatic Detection**: Detect when additional detail is needed and prompt the user for more information if necessary.

## 5. **Final Output:**

   - **Comprehensive Outline**: Provide the user with a fully expanded and detailed outline, complete with subheadings and sub-subheadings.
   - **Document Generation**: Optionally, generate a full draft document based on the expanded outline.

# Conceptual Framework for the Recursive Outline Expansion Engine

```plaintext
1. Detect User Intent:
   - Understand the user's goal (e.g., essay, research paper).
   - Gather context from the chat thread.

2. Generate Initial Outline:
   - Identify main sections based on user intent and context.
   - Allow user to review and adjust the initial outline.

3. Recursive Expansion:
   - For each section in the outline:
     - Expand the section to include subheadings and sub-subheadings.
     - Generate multiple paragraphs or bullet points for each subheading.
     - Ensure each section is expanded to the appropriate level of detail.

4. Iterative Refinement:
   - Solicit feedback from the user to refine the outline and content.
   - Adjust the level of detail and structure based on user preferences.
   - Prompt the user for more information if additional detail is needed.

5. Final Output:
   - Provide a fully expanded and detailed outline.
   - Optionally, generate a full draft document based on the expanded outline.

# Detailed Instructions for the Recursive Expansion Engine

```plaintext
1. Detect User Intent:
   - Analyze the user's initial request (e.g., "Generate an essay on climate change").
   - Extract key topics, themes, and any previous outlines or drafts from the chat thread.

2. Generate Initial Outline:
   - Based on the user's intent and context, generate an initial outline with main sections.
   - Example Outline for an Essay:
     ```
     1. Introduction
     2. Background Information
     3. Causes of Climate Change
     4. Effects of Climate Change
     5. Solutions and Mitigation Strategies
     6. Conclusion
     ```

3. Recursive Expansion:
   - For each section in the outline:
     - Expand the section to include subheadings and sub-subheadings.
     - Example Expansion for "Causes of Climate Change":
       ```
       1. Causes of Climate Change
         3.1 Human Activities
           3.1.1 Industrialization
           3.1.2 Deforestation
           3.1.3 Fossil Fuel Usage
         3.2 Natural Phenomena
           3.2.1 Volcanic Eruptions
           3.2.2 Solar Radiation Variations
       ```

4. Iterative Refinement:
   - Prompt the user for feedback on the expanded outline.
   - Example Feedback Loop:
     - User: "Add more detail on deforestation."
     - System: Expand the "Deforestation" subheading with additional points and paragraphs.
     - Repeat the process until the user is satisfied.

5. Final Output:
   - Provide the user with a fully expanded and detailed outline.
   - Optionally, generate a full draft document based on the expanded outline.

# Summary

This recursive outline expansion engine aims to intelligently generate and refine outlines based on user intent and context. By recursively expanding each section and soliciting feedback, the system ensures that the final output is comprehensive and meets the user’s needs. The system continuously adapts and refines the outline, providing a seamless and efficient writing experience.
