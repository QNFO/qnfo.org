You are absolutely correct. My apologies, I got caught up in the structure and process of scientific knowledge and theory building, and lost sight of the broader initial point. The core of your original statement wasn’t just about the scientific method, but about the nature of knowledge itself – its inherent transience, its building-block nature, and the importance of embracing intellectual evolution. The scientific method is one example of this process, but the principle applies more widely.
Let’s try again, focusing on knowledge in general, not exclusively scientific theories. We’ll still use the “postulate” framework, as it’s helpful for outlining foundational principles.
Postulates for the Nature and Progression of Knowledge:
 - Impermanence: All knowledge is inherently impermanent, subject to revision, refinement, or obsolescence as new information, perspectives, and contexts emerge. (This generalizes the “all models are wrong” idea to all forms of knowledge.)
 - Contextuality: Knowledge is understood and interpreted within a specific context, and its validity or relevance may change as that context shifts. (This acknowledges that what is “true” or “useful” can depend on the situation.)
 - Cumulative Growth: New knowledge typically builds upon existing knowledge, integrating, expanding, or refining previous understandings, rather than completely replacing them. (This captures the “building block” concept, applicable to various fields.)
 - Integrative Potential: The strength and value of new knowledge often lie in its ability to synthesize and connect disparate pieces of existing knowledge, creating a more comprehensive and coherent understanding. (This emphasizes the importance of synthesis across disciplines.)
 - Iterative Evolution: The process of knowledge acquisition and refinement is iterative and ongoing, with new discoveries and insights continually prompting further inquiry and revision. (This highlights the cyclical nature of learning and understanding.)
 - Openness to Supersession: Intellectual progress requires a willingness to embrace new ideas and perspectives that may supersede existing knowledge, even if those new ideas challenge deeply held beliefs. (This emphasizes the importance of intellectual humility and adaptability.)
 - Utility as Value: Although all knowledge is subject to change the utility of a concept within a given framework should determine its current value.
Explanation and Importance:
These postulates apply to a much broader range of intellectual endeavors than just science. They apply to:
 - History: Historical interpretations change as new evidence is uncovered and societal perspectives evolve.
 - Philosophy: Philosophical ideas are constantly debated and refined, with new arguments building upon or challenging older ones.
 - Technology: Technological advancements build upon previous innovations, often rendering older technologies obsolete.
 - Personal Understanding: Our own personal beliefs and knowledge are constantly evolving as we gain new experiences and learn from others.
 - The arts: The arts evolve practices of expression through the reinterpretation of ideas.
The crucial difference here is that we’ve removed the specific constraints of the scientific method (testability, falsifiability, etc.) and focused on the broader principles of how any form of knowledge changes and grows. We’re emphasizing the process of intellectual evolution, regardless of the specific field or discipline. The key is the recognition that knowledge is a living, dynamic entity, not a static collection of facts. The postulates describe its inherent impermanence, its building-block structure, and the importance of intellectual openness. This gets much closer to your original point.
