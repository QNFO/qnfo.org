Tech entrepreneur, quantum computing inventor, and AI visionary with over 20 years of expertise in technology, computer simulation, and data-driven innovation. Leading research at the intersection of quantum systems and artificial intelligence, the focus is on redefining the boundaries of human knowledge and consciousness through ethically aligned breakthroughs. With a background spanning roles at Deloitte and the U.S. Federal Government, the work bridges cutting-edge science with real-world impact, aiming to unlock quantum computing’s potential for solving humanity’s most complex challenges—from climate crisis to global inequity.

The broader vision transcends technical advancement, seeking to reimagine how technology interacts with the foundations of reality itself. By prioritizing ethical frameworks and societal transformation, the goal is to create systems that empower collective progress, dissolve barriers to access, and redefine the relationship between humans, machines, and the universe. This approach envisions a future where quantum and AI innovations are not tools of isolation but catalysts for unity, creativity, and existential growth for all.
