As the saying goes “all models are wrong, but some are useful.” Any knowledge eventually fades into obsolescence (see geocentrism, ethers, and alchemy). Theories will eventually be shown incomplete and the ultimatum of empiricism is a dead end in that new knowledge begets new knowledge so the more knowledge can be synthesized and incorporated into a theory, the higher it’s explanatory power and that’s kind of an important concept to realize that new theory should be able to incorporate everything that is known before into them not necessarily rejecting old theories but expanding them and augmenting them. We should embrace superseding thought with the comfort that today’s knowledge provides the foundation upon which the future can stand.
