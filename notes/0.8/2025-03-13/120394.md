# My Perspective: The Universe as an Informational Tapestry

Through my research, I propose that the universe is fundamentally informational—a dynamic system where physical laws, consciousness, and even our imaginative constructs emerge from the interplay of information principles. This framework builds upon the foundational work of many pioneers, including John Wheeler, Integrated Information Theory (IIT), and the holographic principle. Below, I share my perspective, contrasting it with mainstream views while grounding it in their influential ideas.

At the universe’s foundation, I argue that quantum entanglement and information form the bedrock of reality. Physical forces are not primal entities but emergent expressions of deeper informational principles. Gravity arises from contrast—differences in mass-energy distribution that warp spacetime. A planet’s gravity is a stark contrast between its density and the emptiness of space, curving spacetime. Electromagnetism reflects state change—dynamic transitions in charge, such as electrons emitting photons. These transitions encode information, enabling light and communication. The strong force relies on mimicry—symmetry in quark interactions that bind nuclei. Protons and neutrons mimic each other’s structural roles through this symmetry. The weak force embodies cause and effect—particle transformations like radioactive decay, where one event (such as neutron decay) directly triggers another (such as proton formation).

This model inverts conventional hierarchies: information isn’t a tool for describing physics—it is the fabric of physics.

Consciousness, in my view, is not merely an epiphenomenon of brains but an active participant in reality’s construction. My research highlights two key roles: quantum influence and imaginative constructs. Conscious observation (or thought experiments) may influence quantum events, shaping probabilities into outcomes. While not mystical, this aligns with the participatory role of observers in quantum mechanics. Consciousness also generates non-physical realities, such as dark matter hypotheses or fictional universes, which refine our understanding of the physical. These are stepping stones, akin to how geocentrism evolved into heliocentrism.

Reality unfolds in layered stages: the quantum/information layer, where entanglement and information principles reign; the spacetime layer, which emerges from these principles and is governed by general relativity; the classical physics layer, where Newtonian mechanics provides a macroscopic approximation; and the imaginative constructs layer, where hypotheses like dark matter or the many-worlds interpretation (MWI) act as intermediate models, filling gaps until deeper insights emerge. Dark matter, for instance, is not just a placeholder but a conceptual bridge between empirical data and multiverse theories. Similarly, MWI, while speculative, mirrors how fiction inspires scientific progress.

My framework builds upon the foundational work of many pioneers, including John Wheeler, Integrated Information Theory (IIT), and the holographic principle. John Wheeler’s concept of “it from bit” laid the groundwork for seeing the universe as fundamentally informational. IIT, developed by Giulio Tononi, explores how integrated information gives rise to consciousness, aligning with my view that consciousness is an active participant in shaping reality. The holographic principle, which suggests that all the information contained in a volume of space can be represented as a theory on the boundary of that space, further supports the idea that information is the fundamental fabric of the universe.

My framework diverges from conventional paradigms in three key ways. First, consciousness’s role: mainstream views often dismiss consciousness as an emergent property of brains with no causal role in physics. In contrast, I argue that consciousness actively shapes reality by influencing quantum measurements and inspiring imaginative models that refine our understanding. Second, information’s primacy: mainstream views see information as a descriptive tool for physical processes. I propose that information is the fundamental substrate—forces and spacetime are its manifestations. Third, multiverse and imaginative constructs: mainstream views often treat MWI and dark matter as literal physical realities. I see these as conceptual tools—stepping stones toward deeper truths, much like how geocentrism evolved into relativity.

Two questions remain contentious: Is consciousness a cause (influencing quantum events) or an effect (a byproduct of brains)? Is information a fundamental layer or a human construct for describing physics? My research leans toward the former in both cases, but the debate underscores the universe’s profound complexity.
