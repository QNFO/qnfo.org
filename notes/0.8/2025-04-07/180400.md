How infomatics improves existing paradigms

1. Incorporates Penrose and hammerhoff’s beliefs about consciousness (and by extension time nonlinearity and seeming reversibility as an artifact of human perception) but they fail to see quantum mechanics as an information State and view it as particles
2. Also recognizes the holographic principle (Susskind) and computational nature of reality (Wheeler), which lack formalisms
3. All of these fall into limitations imposed by Newtonian physics, general relativity, and/or an incomplete understanding of quantum mechanics (especially wave function collapse, Copenhagen interpretation)
4. No major theory recognizes that underlying all of this is an insistence in math formalisms that fall short under existing paradigms (limitations of zero and causing singularities, and general non-linearity of our number line)
5. infomatics finds that measurement doesn’t have to collapse the wave function it’s an artifact of the discretization process of measurement not necessarily in the measurement itself
6. Science gets hung up on terminology like particle versus wave without realizing that to some extent it doesn’t matter these are these are constructs and limitations of our constructs and even even our system of math is a construct
7. Biologic systems don’t need brains. They just increase processing ability. Perhaps I don’t know, but to think that a brain is what makes us conscious is misguided
