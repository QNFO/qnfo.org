Okay, here is a table compiling the various approaches to unification and quantum gravity we’ve discussed, comparing some of their key features.

Disclaimer: This table provides a simplified overview. Many theories are complex, have variations, overlap, and are highly speculative. The “Status/Key Challenge” reflects common viewpoints but isn’t exhaustive.
