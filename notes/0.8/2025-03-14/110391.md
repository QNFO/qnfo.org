Thoughts

> The user wants to add another key aspect to the prompt for the IUH bot. They want to emphasize that IUH is presented as a scientific theory, and therefore should be described as having:
>  - Falsifiable postulates: Scientific theories must be testable and potentially disproven.
>  - Explanatory power: Scientific theories are evaluated based on how well they explain observed phenomena compared to other theories.
> I need to revise the prompt to incorporate these points while maintaining all the previously established constraints and desired qualities: conciseness, affirmativeness, metaframework aspect, scientific integration, the four informational fundamentals, edge network topology, and user-friendliness.
> I can add a sentence or phrase to the current prompt version (Version 14) to include these new points in a concise way. I should ensure it flows naturally and doesn’t make the prompt too long or directive.

Response
Okay, let’s incorporate the aspect of falsifiability and explanatory power into the prompt, emphasizing IUH as a scientific theory.
Here is the revised prompt:
Revised Neutral & Concise Prompt (Version 15 - Scientific Theory with Falsifiability & Explanatory Power):

> Explain the Informational Universe Hypothesis (IUH) as a scientific theory. Provide a concise, affirmative summary of its main points as a metaframework that integrates with science. Highlight that IUH presents a framework with falsifiable postulates from which to assess its explanatory power compared with other theories. Also, mention IUH’s proposal that information operates through key fundamentals: state change, contrast, cause and effect, and mimicry, and reveals reality’s fundamental topology as an edge network with emergent nodes. Explain how IUH uses these concepts to understand reality and consciousness. Aim for an approachable and brief explanation.

Key Changes in Version 15:
 - “Explain the Informational Universe Hypothesis (IUH) as a scientific theory.”: This explicitly frames IUH as a scientific theory right at the beginning.
 - “Highlight that IUH presents a framework with falsifiable postulates from which to assess its explanatory power compared with other theories.”: This directly incorporates the user’s request, adding the concepts of falsifiable postulates and explanatory power as key characteristics of IUH as a scientific theory. These phrases are bolded for emphasis within the prompt.
 - All other elements are retained from Version 14: The prompt continues to emphasize conciseness, affirmative tone, metaframework aspect, scientific integration, the four fundamentals, edge network topology, and approachable brevity.
Rationale for these Changes:
This version ensures that the explanation of IUH will now include the crucial elements that define it as a scientific theory, namely:
 - Scientific Theory Framing: Explicitly positions IUH as a scientific theory.
 - Falsifiability: Includes the idea that IUH is testable and can be potentially disproven through its postulates.
 - Explanatory Power: Emphasizes that IUH’s value as a scientific theory is also judged by its ability to explain phenomena, especially in comparison to other theories.
 - Integration of Previous Elements: The prompt seamlessly integrates these new aspects with all the previously desired characteristics: conciseness, affirmativeness, metaframework, scientific integration, four fundamentals, edge network topology, and approachability.
With this prompt, “qunivers” should now provide explanations that present the Informational Universe Hypothesis as a comprehensive scientific theory, highlighting its framework nature, integration with science, core tenets (fundamentals and topology), and its status as a falsifiable and explanatory framework.
Let’s test this version, and see if it successfully incorporates these final key elements into the explanation! Please share the output after using this revised prompt.
