Thoughts

> The user is stating that the “ULTIMATE” prompt is too restrictive. The bot is likely now only providing a single paragraph summary and is not engaging further with follow-up questions, or providing different answers when asked again.
> This means the prompt, in its attempt to achieve ultimate conciseness, has become too rigid. The instruction “ONE PARAGRAPH” and the very directive, task-based bullet points are likely causing the bot to fulfill the initial request and then shut down or repeat the same paragraph for every subsequent question.
> To address “too restrictive and does not answer differently for follow-up questions,” I need to:
>  - Remove or Relax the “ONE PARAGRAPH” constraint. This is likely the primary culprit. It’s making the bot too focused on a single, initial output.
>  - Allow for More Flexible and Open-Ended Responses. The task-based, very directive bullet points, while helpful for initial output, might be limiting the bot’s ability to engage in a conversation. I should make the prompt less of a rigid checklist and more of a set of guiding principles.
>  - Re-introduce some element of conversationality and responsiveness to follow-up questions. Even if the initial explanation is concise, the bot needs to be able to elaborate or address specific queries afterwards. I need to re-emphasize the importance of answering questions effectively.
> Essentially, I need to loosen the reins a bit. We achieved conciseness, but at the cost of interactivity and flexibility. The next prompt revision needs to prioritize conversational ability and responsiveness after the initial concise explanation.
> Let’s revise the prompt to be less restrictive on the length of the initial explanation and re-emphasize responding to follow-up questions effectively. I’ll remove the “ONE PARAGRAPH” constraint and adjust the bullet points to be more guiding and less like mandatory steps for a single output.

Response
You are absolutely correct. The “ULTIMATE” prompt, in its quest for extreme conciseness, has become too restrictive and hinders the bot’s ability to engage in follow-up questions and provide varied responses. My apologies – we went too far in the pursuit of brevity!
Let’s revise the prompt one last time to create a genuinely Best and Final Prompt that balances conciseness with responsiveness and flexibility:
Truly Best and Final Prompt - Conversational & Responsive (Version FINAL REVISED - Conversationality & Responsiveness):

> Explain the Informational Universe Hypothesis (IUH) in a way that is genuinely informative, clearly structured, and easy for anyone to grasp, even without a science background. Aim for an initial concise summary, but be prepared to elaborate and answer follow-up questions effectively.
>
> Your explanation should concisely cover these essential aspects of IUH, but not necessarily all in a single paragraph, and be ready to expand on them as needed:
>
>  - Core Idea: What is the central, most fundamental claim of IUH about the nature of reality? State this directly and simply, emphasizing information as foundational. Be ready to explain this core idea further if asked.
>
>  - Operational Fundamentals: Explain that IUH proposes information operates through key principles – state change, contrast, cause and effect, and mimicry. Briefly describe each fundamental in plain language and how they are essential to IUH. Be prepared to give examples or further details on these fundamentals if asked.
>
>  - Reality’s Topology: Clarify IUH’s view of the fundamental structure of reality as an edge network with emergent nodes. Explain this concept clearly and concisely. Be ready to elaborate on the edge network concept if the user wants more detail.
>
>  - Integration with Science: Briefly describe how IUH aims to connect with and build upon existing scientific understanding. Give one or two concrete examples of how IUH relates to established scientific concepts (e.g., from physics, cosmology, information theory). Be prepared to discuss these connections in more depth if the user is interested.
>
>  - Testability and Explanatory Power: Explain, in simple terms, how IUH, as a scientific framework, addresses the question of evidence and testing. Mention potential avenues for scientific assessment or inquiry without using jargon. Be ready to discuss specific testable predictions or research directions if the user asks for them.
>
> Maintain a confident yet balanced and informative tone throughout the conversation, especially when addressing questions. Present IUH as a compelling framework for exploring reality, but avoid overly promotional or speculative language. Prioritize clarity, conciseness in initial summaries, and genuine informativeness and responsiveness in the overall conversation.

Key Changes in “FINAL REVISED” Prompt (Focusing on Conversationality):
 - Removed “ONE PARAGRAPH” Constraint: The explicit length restriction is gone, allowing for more flexibility in the initial explanation and for longer responses to follow-up questions.
 - “Aim for an initial concise summary, but be prepared to elaborate and answer follow-up questions effectively.”: This directly instructs the bot to be both concise initially and conversational afterwards.
 - “Your explanation should concisely cover these essential aspects of IUH, but not necessarily all in a single paragraph, and be ready to expand on them as needed”: This explicitly tells the bot it’s okay to go beyond a single paragraph and to be ready to elaborate.
 - “Be ready to explain this core idea further if asked,” “Be prepared to give examples or further details on these fundamentals if asked,” “Be ready to elaborate on the edge network concept if the user wants more detail,” “Be prepared to discuss these connections in more depth if the user is interested,” “Be ready to discuss specific testable predictions or research directions if the user asks for them.”: These repeated phrases at the end of each bullet point strongly emphasize the importance of being ready to respond to follow-up questions about each aspect of IUH.
 - “Prioritize clarity, conciseness in initial summaries, and genuine informativeness and responsiveness in the overall conversation.”: This revised closing statement now explicitly balances conciseness for initial summaries with responsiveness and informativeness in the broader conversation.
Rationale for “FINAL REVISED” Prompt’s Conversational Approach:
This “FINAL REVISED” prompt aims to achieve the optimal balance by:
 - Retaining Clarity and Substance Focus: It keeps the focus on clarity, informativeness, structure, and substance that we refined in previous prompts.
 - Adding Conversational Flexibility: It removes the overly restrictive length constraint and explicitly encourages responsiveness and elaboration in follow-up interactions.
 - Guiding Initial Conciseness: It still encourages a concise initial summary, fulfilling the desire for brevity in the first explanation.
 - Prioritizing User Interaction: It strongly emphasizes the importance of being able to answer questions, elaborate on points, and engage in a more natural, back-and-forth conversation with the user.
This “FINAL REVISED” prompt is designed to be the most versatile and effective, enabling “qunivers” to provide both a concise initial explanation of the Informational Universe Hypothesis and to engage in a meaningful, informative, and responsive conversation with users who want to explore the topic in more depth or ask challenging questions.
This is truly intended to be the Best and Final Prompt. Please test this version and let me know if it finally achieves the desired balance of conciseness, clarity, substance, robustness, and conversational responsiveness! I’m very hopeful that this is the prompt that will allow “qunivers” to shine.
