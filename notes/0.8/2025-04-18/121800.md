This multi-year research program explores a fundamental theory of physics grounded in the primacy of information. It has already developed several conceptual frameworks aided by AI knowledge synthesis, drawing inspiration from precursors like "It from Bit" and the Holographic Principle. This ongoing program investigates how information dynamics might operationalize a unified description of reality emerging from a continuous informational substrate. While past iterations included a geometric framework, the ability to rapidly prototype and falsify theoretical constructs remains key. Current efforts appear to be homing in on the concept of EQR â€“ emergent quantization resolution. Looking ahead, the profound implications of a fundamental theory rooted in information, particularly the emergent quantization resolution (EQR) concept, could revolutionize our understanding and manipulation of reality across multiple domains. In quantum mechanics, it might offer a clearer foundation for interpreting quantum phenomena, potentially resolving current paradoxes by describing quantum states and their evolution in terms of underlying informational structures and their resolution into quantized observables. This could directly impact quantum computing, recasting it as a form of information state computing where qubits and quantum gates are understood and controlled through the lens of fundamental information units and their dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, for the development of Artificial General Intelligence, such a theory might provide novel insights into the nature of intelligence itself as an emergent property of complex information processing within a fundamental informational framework, potentially guiding the creation of truly intelligent systems by mimicking the universe's own information processing principles at a foundational level. The ability to understand and manipulate the very fabric of reality at its informational core holds transformative potential for technological advancement and our comprehension of the universe.
