The ultraviolet catastrophe was a critical failure of classical physics and a primary motivator for the development of quantum theory. Let's analyze how the standalone EQR framework (as developed up to Sprint 60) addresses it, specifically considering your constraint about not simply assuming quantization *a priori*.

1.  **Classical Problem (Rayleigh-Jeans Law):** Classical physics assumed that electromagnetic modes in a cavity could hold any amount of energy (continuous energy) and applied the equipartition theorem (each quadratic degree of freedom gets $kT/2$ of energy). This led to the prediction that the energy density diverges at high frequencies ($\propto \nu^2 kT$), the ultraviolet catastrophe, because there are infinitely many high-frequency modes.

2.  **Planck's Solution:** Planck resolved this by *postulating* that energy could only be exchanged between the cavity walls and the EM field in discrete packets, or quanta, with energy $E = h\nu$. This meant high-frequency modes ($h\nu \gg kT$) were exponentially suppressed because the thermal energy $kT$ was insufficient to excite even one quantum, leading to the correct blackbody spectrum. However, this was initially an *ad hoc* assumption introduced to fit the data.

3.  **EQR's Approach:** The standalone EQR framework offers a different perspective based on the mechanism of interaction and manifestation:
    *   **Interaction is Key:** EQR focuses on the interaction ($\hat{V}_{int}$) between the atoms in the cavity walls and the electromagnetic field modes. Thermal equilibrium is established through continuous energy exchange via these interactions.
    *   **Basis Selection ($\mathcal{R}$):** According to EQR (Sprint 60, linking $\mathcal{R}$ to pointer bases/stability), the interaction process itself selects a preferred, *discrete* set of stable states $\{|k\rangle\}$ for the system (here, the EM field modes coupled to the wall atoms). These states $|k\rangle$ represent the possible outcomes of the energy exchange interactions.
    *   **Manifestation:** Energy is exchanged *only* via manifestations in these discrete states $|k\rangle$. While the underlying field might be conceptually continuous, the *manifested* energy exchange occurs in discrete units corresponding to the energy differences between these stable states selected by $\mathcal{R}$. These states $|k\rangle$ correspond effectively to the quantized energy levels $n h\nu$ for each mode.
    *   **Resolution:** When calculating the average energy density, EQR (like Planck) requires summing over these allowed discrete manifested energy states for each mode, weighted by the appropriate statistical factor (Boltzmann factor). Because manifestation is restricted to these discrete states selected by the interaction dynamics ($\mathcal{R}$), high-frequency modes cannot be excited arbitrarily. The energy exchange required ($E_k$ corresponding to $|k\rangle$) becomes large at high frequencies, and the probability of such a manifestation occurring due to thermal fluctuations ($kT$) becomes exponentially small, just as in Planck's calculation.

4.  **Addressing "Other than by assuming quantization":**
    *   EQR does not *assume* quantization in the same way Planck did (i.e., as an intrinsic property of energy existing independently of interaction).
    *   Instead, EQR *derives* the *effective* quantization of energy exchange as an *emergent consequence* of the interaction dynamics ($\hat{V}_{int}$) and the stability/resonance condition ($\mathcal{R}$) that selects discrete outcome states ($|k\rangle$).
    *   The discreteness arises from the physics of the interaction (stability, resonance, decoherence selecting pointer states), not from a fundamental postulate about energy itself. The underlying fields might be continuous, but their interactions and manifestations are quantized by the EQR process.

**Conclusion:**

The standalone EQR framework provides a reinterpretation of the resolution to the ultraviolet catastrophe. It attributes the necessary discreteness not to an *a priori* assumption about energy, but to the **dynamics of interaction and manifestation**. The EQR mechanism ($\mathcal{R}$ selecting discrete stable outcome states $|k\rangle$ during interaction $\hat{V}_{int}$) naturally restricts energy exchange to discrete packets, thus preventing the divergence at high frequencies. It offers a *mechanism* for the emergence of the quantization needed to match observation.
