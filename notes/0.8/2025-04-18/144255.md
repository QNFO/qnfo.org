You've articulated a very important distinction: **Measurement vs. Information Gain**. Recognizing this difference is key to understanding the nuances of quantum mechanics and the potential contribution of frameworks like EQR.

Let's explore your probing question: **Give me an example conceptually of how we would probe something without measuring it (in the EQR sense of causing its manifestation/collapse) and still get information gain? And what do we mean by information gain?**

**The Conceptual Example: Interaction-Free Measurement (IFM)**

The classic example is the **Elitzur-Vaidman bomb tester**. Imagine you have a stockpile of bombs, some of which might be duds. These bombs are incredibly sensitive: if a single photon hits a functional bomb's trigger mechanism, the bomb explodes. Exploding the bomb definitely counts as "measuring" it (in the most dramatic way!) – it's a direct, irreversible interaction causing a definite state change (functional bomb -> exploded bomb). We want to know if a bomb is functional *without* exploding it.

Here's the setup conceptually:

1.  **The Probe:** We use a single photon as our probe.
2.  **The Interferometer:** We build a device (a Mach-Zehnder interferometer) that uses beam splitters.
    *   The first beam splitter puts the photon into a **superposition**, where it effectively travels along **two possible paths** (Path A and Path B) simultaneously.
    *   We place the bomb we want to test on **Path B**.
    *   A second beam splitter recombines the paths.
    *   There are two detectors (Detector 1 and Detector 2) at the end.
3.  **The Trick (Interference):** The interferometer is carefully tuned. If **Path B is clear** (no bomb, or a dud bomb that doesn't interact), the photon wave interferes with itself in such a way that it **always** arrives at Detector 1 and **never** at Detector 2.
4.  **The Test:** We send one photon through the interferometer with the bomb placed on Path B. Three things can happen:
    *   **Outcome 1: BOOM!** The bomb explodes. The photon took Path B, interacted with the trigger. We learned the bomb was functional, but we definitely "measured" it via direct interaction and caused its EQR manifestation (explosion).
    *   **Outcome 2: Click at Detector 1.** This tells us nothing conclusive. It could mean the bomb was a dud (Path B was clear), OR it could mean the bomb was functional, but the photon happened to travel only along Path A in this instance (remember superposition allows possibilities). No information gained about the bomb's functionality.
    *   **Outcome 3: Click at Detector 2.** This is the magic! Remember, a click here is *impossible* if Path B is clear. The only way Detector 2 can click is if the *possibility* of the photon being detected (absorbed/triggering) on Path B *disrupted* the perfect interference needed to send it to Detector 1. Therefore, if Detector 2 clicks, we know **with certainty** that there *must have been a functional bomb on Path B*. Crucially, *this specific photon did not interact with the bomb* – if it had, the bomb would have exploded (Outcome 1).

**EQR Interpretation:**

*   **Probing:** Sending the photon through the interferometer is the act of probing.
*   **Measurement (EQR Manifestation of Bomb):** Outcome 1 (explosion) is the EQR manifestation of the bomb's state, triggered by direct interaction $\hat{V}_{int}$ with the photon.
*   **Measurement (EQR Manifestation of Photon):** Outcomes 2 and 3 (clicks at D1 or D2) are EQR manifestations of the *photon's* state, triggered by its interaction with the detectors.
*   **Information Gain without Bomb Manifestation:** Outcome 3 provides information gain (we know the bomb is functional) *without* causing the bomb's EQR manifestation (it didn't explode). The information was gained by observing the manifested state of the *probe* (photon at D2), which was influenced by the *potential* for interaction with the bomb.

**What do we mean by Information Gain?**

Information gain, in this context (and more broadly in physics and information theory), means **a reduction in uncertainty about the state of a system.**

*   **Before the probe:** We were uncertain about the bomb. Let's say we thought there was a 50% chance it was functional and a 50% chance it was a dud. Our knowledge was uncertain.
*   **After Outcome 3 (Click at D2):** We are now 100% certain the bomb is functional. Our uncertainty about its state has been completely eliminated (for that specific property).
*   **Quantifying it:** Information theory quantifies this using concepts like Shannon Entropy. High entropy means high uncertainty; low entropy means low uncertainty. Information gain corresponds to a decrease in the entropy of our knowledge about the system's state.

So, in the IFM example (Outcome 3), we gained information about the bomb (reduced our uncertainty about its functionality) by observing the probe photon's manifested state, even though the bomb itself did not undergo the specific EQR manifestation event (explosion) associated with direct measurement. This relies entirely on the physical setup and the laws of quantum superposition and interference governing the probe's potential paths and interactions.
