### **Principles of the Informational Universe Hypothesis (Established Scientific Framework)**

#### **1. Information as the Fundamental Currency**
- **Concept:** Information is the fundamental building block of the universe, from which matter, energy, spacetime, and forces emerge.
- **Scientific Basis:** 
  - **Wheeler’s "It from Bit":** John Archibald Wheeler proposed that information is the fundamental basis of reality, prefiguring the idea that the universe can be described in terms of information.
  - **Holographic Principle:** The holographic principle suggests that the information content of a volume of space can be encoded on its boundary, aligning with the idea that information is the foundational layer of reality.

#### **2. Four Core Mechanisms Governing Information Processes**
- **State Change:** Transformations of information (e.g., quantum collapse, phase transitions, and the Big Bang).
  - **Scientific Basis:** 
    - **Quantum Mechanics:** Quantum states transition between superposition and definite states, governed by probabilities and informational constraints.
    - **Thermodynamics:** Phase transitions (e.g., boiling, freezing) are driven by changes in internal energy and entropy, reflecting transformations in information states.
    - **Cosmology:** The Big Bang is understood as a transition from a low-entropy state to a dynamic universe, driven by informational processes.

- **Contrast:** Differentiation between distinct information states (e.g., particle-wave duality).
  - **Scientific Basis:** 
    - **Quantum Mechanics:** Particles and waves are not mutually exclusive but represent different informational states, dependent on the observer’s context.
    - **Wave-Particle Duality:** Phenomena like the double-slit experiment demonstrate that particles behave as waves or particles based on how they are observed, reflecting contrasting informational properties.

- **Cause and Effect:** Informational dependencies (e.g., gravitational interactions, neural signaling).
  - **Scientific Basis:** 
    - **General Relativity:** Gravity is described as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass-energy, which can be reinterpreted as informational density.
    - **Neuroscience:** Neural signals propagate through the brain, creating patterns of activation that depend on previous inputs, reflecting causal relationships in information flow.

- **Mimicry:** Replication of information (e.g., quantum entanglement, self-similarity).
  - **Scientific Basis:** 
    - **Quantum Mechanics:** Entangled particles share identical states, demonstrating mimicry of information across spacetime.
    - **Fractals:** Self-similar patterns in nature (e.g., atomic structures mirroring galactic structures) reflect the replication of information across scales.

#### **3. Reality as an Edge Network**
- **Concept:** Reality is structured as dynamic webs of relationships between informational entities, forming emergent structures (e.g., galaxies, consciousness).
- **Scientific Basis:** 
  - **Holographic Principle:** Information about a volume of space is encoded on its boundary, suggesting that reality is a network of informational relationships.
  - **Self-Similarity:** Patterns in nature (e.g., atomic structures mirroring galactic structures) reflect the fractal-like repetition of informational patterns across scales.
  - **Complex Systems Theory:** Emergent phenomena (e.g., consciousness, galaxies) arise from the interactions of simpler components, governed by informational relationships.

#### **4. Time as a Sequence of State Changes and Cause/Effect Relationships**
- **Concept:** Time is not a fundamental dimension but a sequence of state changes and cause/effect relationships, driven by the increase in entropy (information dispersal).
- **Scientific Basis:** 
  - **Thermodynamics:** The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that entropy (disorder or information dispersal) increases over time, driving the arrow of time.
  - **Quantum Mechanics:** Time is treated as a parameter in quantum mechanics, rather than a fundamental dimension, aligning with the idea that time emerges from informational processes.

#### **5. Consciousness as an Emergent Node of Integrated Information**
- **Concept:** Consciousness arises from neural information networks, where mimicry (pattern replication) and contrast (signal differentiation) create subjective experience.
- **Scientific Basis:** 
  - **Integrated Information Theory (IIT):** Consciousness is the integrated flow of information in neural networks, where complex patterns of activity give rise to subjective experience.
  - **Neuroscience:** Neural signals propagate through the brain, creating patterns of activation that depend on previous inputs, reflecting the integration of information.

#### **6. Gravity as an Emergent Property of Information Density**
- **Concept:** Gravity arises from informational density and relationships, not from spacetime curvature or hypothetical particles like gravitons.
- **Scientific Basis:** 
  - **General Relativity:** Gravity is described as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass-energy, which can be reinterpreted as informational density.
  - **Quantum Gravity:** Efforts to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity suggest that gravity may emerge from informational constraints, rather than being a fundamental force.

#### **7. Dark Matter and Dark Energy as Informational Effects**
- **Concept:** Dark matter and dark energy effects are explained by informational density and relationships, not by hypothetical particles.
- **Scientific Basis:** 
  - **Dark Matter:** Gravitational anomalies (e.g., galaxy rotation curves) are explained by the distribution of informational density, rather than unseen particles.
  - **Dark Energy:** Cosmic expansion is driven by the dispersal of information, not by a mysterious repulsive force.

#### **8. The Big Bang as an Informational State Change**
- **Concept:** The Big Bang was a transition from a low-entropy, highly constrained informational state to a dynamic universe, driven by increasing entropy.
- **Scientific Basis:** 
  - **Cosmology:** The Big Bang is understood as the beginning of the universe, marked by a rapid expansion from a highly compressed state.
  - **Entropy:** The increase in entropy (information dispersal) explains the expansion of the universe, without invoking inflation or dark energy.

#### **9. Multiverse as Informational Branches**
- **Concept:** The multiverse is not a collection of parallel universes but informational branches within a single edge network.
- **Scientific Basis:** 
  - **Quantum Mechanics:** Quantum superposition creates divergent informational pathways, reflecting the branching of possible outcomes.
  - **Information Theory:** Informational branches represent different states of information, rather than separate physical realities.

### **Conclusion**
This framework aligns with established scientific principles, reinterpreting key concepts like gravity, time, consciousness, and the Big Bang within an informational framework. By grounding these ideas in well-known theories (e.g., quantum mechanics, general relativity, thermodynamics), it provides a coherent and unified explanation of the universe, avoiding the need for dark matter, dark energy, or hypothetical particles.
