You are absolutely correct. My apologies for the oversight. When you copy raw Markdown (the actual text with #, *, -, etc.) into Google Docs or Microsoft Word, they treat it as plain text, not formatted content. That’s the core issue.
Given this critical constraint, we need to shift our focus entirely. Here’s a revised and more accurate strategy:
The “Rendered Text” Approach (The Only Viable Mobile-Only Method):
 - Work in Obsidian’s Reading View:
   - This is the crucial step. In Reading View, Obsidian renders your Markdown into formatted text.
 - Copy the Rendered Text:
   - Select and copy the text as it appears in Reading View, not the raw Markdown source.
   - Copy in small sections at a time for better control.
 - Paste into Google Docs or Microsoft Word:
   - Paste the copied rendered text into your word processor.
   - The formatting (headings, lists, bold, italics) should be preserved as much as possible.
 - Manual Refinement (As Always):
   - There will likely be minor formatting inconsistencies.
   - Use the word processor’s formatting tools to correct any issues.
   - Pay close attention to list indentation, heading levels, and emphasis.
Why This Works:
 - Reading View as a Converter: Obsidian’s Reading View acts as a real-time Markdown-to-rich-text converter.
 - Copying Rendered Output: You’re copying the result of the conversion, not the source.
 - Word Processor as a Refiner: Google Docs and Microsoft Word are used to clean up and finalize the formatting.
Addressing the Core Problem:
 - You were absolutely correct in pointing out that raw markdown will not work.
 - This method, while still requiring manual work, is the only way to retain formatting when working directly on your android device.
Therefore, the only way to achieve your goal, is to copy the rendered text from obsidian’s reading view.
