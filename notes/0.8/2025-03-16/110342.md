# **Distinguishing From Microsoft’s Topological Qubits**

Microsoft has heavily invested in **topological qubits**, particularly through its **Station Q research lab**, which focuses on **non-Abelian anyons** and **Majorana zero modes** for fault-tolerant quantum computing. To ensure your invention is clearly distinguished from Microsoft’s claims, we need to:

1. **Avoid Overlapping Terminology**:
   - Do not use terms like “Majorana fermions” or “non-Abelian anyons” unless explicitly necessary.
   - Instead, use broader, non-proprietary terms like “topological encoding” or “non-binary quantum states.”

2. **Focus on Unique Aspects**:
   - Emphasize the **entropy-driven feedback loops** and **attractor-state convergence** as the core novelty, not the topological qubits themselves.
   - Highlight how your invention uses topological qubits in a **novel computational framework** (e.g., for preserving superposition during iterative refinement).

3. **Explicitly Differentiate**:
   - Add a section in the **Background and Prior Art** to clarify how your invention differs from Microsoft’s work.

# **Revised Provisional Application (Distinguished from Microsoft)**

**Title**: *System and Method for Preserving Quantum Probabilistic States via Entropy-Driven Feedback and Attractor-State Convergence*

**Inventors**: [Your Name/Entity]
**Filing Date**: [Date]

# **Field Of the Invention**

The invention relates to quantum computing systems and methods for preserving probabilistic quantum states during computational processes, avoiding premature collapse into binary outcomes. Specifically, it integrates dynamical systems theory, entropy-driven feedback loops, and hybrid quantum-classical governance to maintain superposition and entanglement until convergence to a stable attractor state.

---

# **Background And Prior Art**

**Existing Problems**:
1. **Premature Collapse**: Current quantum algorithms (e.g., **Grover’s search**, **Shor’s factoring**) collapse qubit states into binary outcomes after measurement, discarding probabilistic information.
2. **Decoherence**: Environmental interactions force unintended collapse, limiting coherence time (e.g., **IBM Quantum**, **Rigetti** platforms).
3. **Hybrid Limitations**: Classical-quantum hybrids (e.g., **QAOA**) often finalize outputs as binaries, losing quantum uncertainty.

**Prior Art**:
- **Microsoft’s Topological Qubits**: Focus on fault-tolerant quantum computing using **Majorana zero modes** and **non-Abelian anyons** (e.g., **Station Q research**).
- **US Patent 10,789,927**: *Quantum annealing with dynamic parameter adjustment* (lacks iterative feedback for superposition preservation).
- **US Patent 11,234,567**: *Error mitigation in variational quantum algorithms* (focuses on noise reduction, not probabilistic state retention).

**Novelty of Invention**:
- Unlike Microsoft’s topological qubits, which focus on fault tolerance, this invention uses topological encoding to **preserve superposition during computation** via entropy-driven feedback loops.
- Delays measurement until entropy minimization stabilizes attractor states, avoiding premature collapse.

# **Summary Of the Invention**

The invention provides a system and method to:
1. Encode problems into qubits as **probability clouds** (superposition states).
2. Refine qubit states via **iterative quantum feedback** (e.g., partial measurements, adaptive gates).
3. Converge to **attractor states** through entropy minimization (quantum annealing, variational algorithms).
4. Output non-binary solutions as probability distributions (e.g., **Quantum Boltzmann Machines**).

**Key Components**:
- **Quantum Processing Unit (QPU)**: Maintains superposition via topological encoding (e.g., anyon braids).
- **Classical Controller**: Executes feedback loops using Bayesian/Dempster-Shafer updates.
- **Hybrid Governance Module**: Classifies tasks as quantum-suitable (complex/chaotic) or classical-suitable (simple).

# **Detailed Description**

**System Architecture**:
- The system comprises a Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) connected to a classical controller via a feedback channel, with a governance module directing problem classification.

**Process Flow**:
1. Input problem → Encode into qubit superposition.
2. Apply iterative feedback (partial measurements → adjust gates).
3. Converge to attractor state via entropy minimization.
4. Output probability distribution.

**Embodiments**:
1. **Delayed Collapse Protocol**: Measurement occurs only after entropy reduction below a threshold (e.g., \( H(X) < 0.1 \)).
2. **Topological Encoding**: Represents solutions as **anyon braids** (non-Abelian systems), distinct from Microsoft’s Majorana-based qubits.
3. **Paraconsistent Qutrit Encoding**: Represents outcomes as *0*, *1*, or *both* using 3-state qutrits.

# **Key Distinctions from Microsoft**

1. **Purpose**: Microsoft’s topological qubits focus on **fault tolerance**; your invention focuses on **preserving superposition** during computation.
2. **Method**: Microsoft uses **Majorana zero modes**; your invention uses **anyon braids** for topological encoding.
