What skill did you learn after age 30?

I learned about both quantum mechanics and academic snobbery, the latter following from the former. But then I also learned ignorance can be bliss and decided to invent instead of arguing with fools.

For the record I also learned how to be comfortable in my own skin after 30 and that I have the right to exist within a broader human collective.

 I also learned that when I stopped living othersâ€™ lives and begin knowing and embracing my own truth fully my reality becomes an attractor state with its own gravity.
