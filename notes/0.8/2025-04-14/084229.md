# ... (rest of metadata for Appendix E) ...
version: 1.1 # Added clarification on Pattern/Wave/Resonance synonymy
revision_notes: |
  v1.0 (2025-04-13): Initial creation.
  v1.1 (2025-04-13): Added clarification that 'Pattern', 'Wave', and 'Resonance' are used largely synonymously to describe Manifest Information (Î). Modified Î definition.

*   **Manifest Information (Î):**
    *   **Definition:** The general category of **actualized, observable phenomena** that emerge *from* the potentiality within the field I through interaction. These are often referred to synonymously as stable **resonant patterns**, **wave patterns**, or simply **resonances**, reflecting their underlying nature as stable, dynamic configurations within the field I exhibiting wave-like properties due to π-φ governance.
    *   **Role:** Represents the "actuality" corresponding to stable resonant states or propagating disturbances within I. Includes entities typically described as particles, energy quanta, fields (in the sense of classical/quantum fields), and localized events. (See Axiom 2).

*   **Resonant State / Pattern / Wave (Î characterized by n, m):**
    *   **Definition:** A **stable, self-sustaining configuration or dynamic pattern** existing within the continuous field I, governed by the π-φ dynamics. These terms are used largely interchangeably to describe instances of Manifest Information (Î). These are the fundamental forms of manifest existence.
    *   **Role:** Corresponds to observable entities like fundamental particles or stable quantum states. Characterized by integer indices $(n, m)$ and potentially topology (Q). (See Section 3).
