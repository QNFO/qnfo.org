Our perception of our existence given our cognitive abilities is entirely ours. Other beings that we understand not to have our human level of cognitive abilities donâ€™t need to worry and use that extra brain power as it were on such frivolities as worrying about what color shirt to wear so that is simply a function of our abilities and then therefore we should also not make the mistake of assuming that we are anything special given enough iterations the single-celled organisms we all evolved from, these things can evolve and sometimes they die out depending on the rules of the game as it were. here too this idea of sequence and repetition take center stage that is how evolution works by sequence and repetition.
