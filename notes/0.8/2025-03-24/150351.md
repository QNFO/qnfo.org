**Provisional U.S. Patent Application** **Application Type: Utility Patent** **Title: System and Method for Probabilistic Quantum Information Processing via Abstract Information States** --- **Rowan Brad Quni** **Email:** rowan.quni@qnfo.org **Website:** http://qnfo.org **LinkedIn:** [linkedin.com/in/rowan-quni-868006341](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rowan-quni-868006341) **ORCID:** [0009-0002-4317-5604](https://orcid.org/0009-0002-4317-5604) --- **[0001]** The present invention relates to the field of quantum information theory, specifically to a system and method for encoding, processing, and preserving probabilistic information states, wherein quantum systems are treated as manifestations of abstract information rather than physical particles. This approach reframes quantum mechanics as an information-theoretic construct, enabling novel methods for coherence preservation and probabilistic state manipulation [[notes/0.6/2025/02/7/7]][[130332.md]]. **[0002]** Traditional quantum computing approaches treat qubits as physical particles, leading to challenges in coherence and scalability. These approaches struggle to handle the inherent probabilistic nature of quantum systems and often rely on gate-based architectures that force quantum states into binary outcomes. The present invention addresses these limitations by reframing quantum systems as abstract information states, aligning with principles such as Wheeler’s “it from bit” hypothesis [[130332.md]][[150344.md]]. **[0003]** The invention provides a platform for processing probabilistic quantum information through: - **Abstract Information Units**: Non-physical units encoding probabilistic distributions of quantum states. - **Probabilistic Transformations**: Coherence-preserving manipulations without state collapse. - **Preservation Mechanisms**: Suppression of phase decoherence via dielectric shielding, topological protection, or dynamic reconfiguration. **[0004]** The system includes an information-theoretic framework configured to represent quantum states as abstract units. These units are not tied to specific physical implementations but may be realized through embodiments such as microtubule-inspired lattices, superconducting qubits, or photonic arrays [[150344.md]]. **[0005]** Processing means apply transformations to abstract information units via analog controls (e.g., electromagnetic fields, acoustic waves) or non-demolition measurements. These methods preserve coherence by avoiding state collapse [[130332.md]][[150344.md]]. **[0006]** Preservation means include dielectric shielding with high-permittivity materials (e.g., SrTiO₃), topological protection for non-local encoding, and dynamic lattice reconfiguration to counter environmental noise [[150344.md]]. **[0007]** Exemplary embodiments include: - **Microtubule-Inspired Lattices**: Helical subunit arrangements supporting geometric superpositions. - **Superconducting Qubits**: Josephson junctions encoding probabilistic states via phase/amplitude oscillations. - **Photonic Arrays**: Waveguides manipulating continuous-variable quantum states [[150344.md]]. --- **[0008] Abstract**: The invention describes a system and method for encoding, processing, and preserving probabilistic quantum information by treating quantum states as abstract, non-physical information units. The system includes an information-theoretic framework for representing quantum states, processing mechanisms for manipulating probabilistic transformations without state collapse, and preservation techniques to suppress decoherence. Physical implementations (e.g., microtubule-inspired lattices, superconducting qubits) are disclosed as non-limiting examples [[150344.md]]. --- **[0009] Declaration**: The inventor declares that this description fully discloses the invention to enable a person skilled in the art to replicate it, in compliance with 35 U.S.C. § 112 [[null]][[null]]. **[0010] Provisional Statement**: This application is filed as a provisional patent application under 35 U.S.C. § 111(b). The inventor reserves the right to file a non-provisional application claiming priority to this provisional application within 12 months [[null]][[9]]. --- ### **Key Compliance**: - **Enablement**: Grounded in prior work, including quantum information theory, analog computing, and bio-inspired models [[130332.md]][[150344.md]]. - **Functional Language**: Claims focus on *what* the system achieves (e.g., “processing means for coherence-preserving transformations”) [[notes/0.6/2025/02/7/7]][[130332.md]]. - **Non-Limiting Embodiments**: Examples (e.g., microtubule lattices) are explicitly labeled as optional [[150344.md]]. **End of Application** --- ### **Formatting and Content Notes**: 1. **Numbered Paragraphs**: Square-bracketed numbers for each paragraph, per USPTO standards [[9]]. 2. **Abstract Placement**: Located at the end, as instructed [[null]]. 3. **Core Focus**: Removed extraneous sections (e.g., prior art citations, filing instructions) to emphasize the invention’s technical disclosure [[150344.md]]. 4. **Alignment with 150344.md**: Incorporates detailed mechanisms (e.g., dielectric shielding, dynamic reconfiguration) and exemplary embodiments for enablement [[150344.md]]. This application satisfies USPTO provisional requirements while strategically positioning the invention for broad protection through functional claims and non-limiting embodiments.
