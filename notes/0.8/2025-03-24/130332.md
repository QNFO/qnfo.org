Thank you for clarifying—this is a profound and nuanced perspective, and I now better understand the core of what you’re trying to achieve. You’re essentially arguing that **quantum systems are fundamentally informational**, and their physical manifestations (e.g., qubits, particles) are secondary to the underlying **abstract information states** that define them. The challenge is to describe this in a patent in a way that:

1. **Captures the abstract, non-physical nature of the invention** (information as the fundamental substrate).
2. **Provides enough specificity to satisfy enablement** (how the invention is implemented in practice).
3. **Avoids tying the claims to specific physical implementations** (e.g., qubits, microtubules) that could limit the patent’s scope or make it vulnerable to design-arounds.

Here’s how to approach this:

---

# **1. Frame the Invention as an Information-Theoretic Platform**

The key is to describe the invention as a **system for manipulating abstract information states**, with physical implementations (e.g., lattices, qubits) serving as optional embodiments. For example:

## **Title:**

“System and Method for Probabilistic Quantum Information Processing via Abstract Information States”

## **Field Of the Invention:**

“The present invention relates to the field of quantum information theory, specifically to a system and method for encoding, processing, and preserving probabilistic information states, wherein quantum systems are treated as manifestations of abstract information rather than physical particles.”

---

# **2. Use Abstract, Functional Language in Claims**

The claims should focus on **what the system does** (manipulate abstract information states) rather than **how it does it** (specific physical implementations). For example:

## **Independent Claim 1 (Core Concept):**

*“A system for processing probabilistic quantum information comprising:
a) an information-theoretic framework configured to represent quantum states as abstract, non-physical information units;
b) processing means for manipulating said information units via probabilistic transformations;
c) preservation means for maintaining the coherence of said information units without inducing collapse to definite states.”*

**Why this works:**
- **Broad Coverage:** Competitors can’t design around by using different physical implementations (e.g., qubits, photonic lattices), because the claim covers *any* system that manipulates abstract information states.
- **Enablement:** The detailed description can provide examples (e.g., “physical implementations may include microtubule-inspired lattices, superconducting qubits, or photonic crystals”) without limiting the claim to those examples.

---

# **3. Describe Physical Implementations as Optional Embodiments**

In the detailed description, frame physical implementations (e.g., microtubules, qubits) as **non-limiting examples** of how the abstract system could be realized. For example:
- *“In one embodiment, the abstract information units are implemented using a microtubule-inspired lattice, wherein tubulin subunits encode probabilistic states via geometric superpositions. However, other physical implementations (e.g., superconducting qubits, photonic arrays) may achieve similar functional outcomes.”*
- *“The preservation means may include dielectric shielding, quantum error correction, or topological protection, though the invention is not limited to these examples.”*

**Why this works:**
- **Enablement:** The patent office sees that the invention is fully described and operable.
- **Broad Coverage:** Competitors can’t argue that the claims are limited to the examples, because the language explicitly states that other embodiments are possible.

---

# **4. Use Dependent Claims for Specific Enhancements**

Use dependent claims to add optional details (e.g., bio-inspired elements) without limiting the independent claims. For example:
- **Claim 2:** *“The system of Claim 1, wherein the information-theoretic framework is implemented using a microtubule-inspired lattice.”*
- **Claim 3:** *“The system of Claim 1, wherein the preservation means comprises dielectric shielding with permittivity sufficient to suppress phase decoherence.”*
- **Claim 4:** *“The system of Claim 1, wherein the processing means leverages analog control mechanisms to steer probabilistic state evolution.”*

**Why this works:**
- **Optional Enhancements:** These claims add value but are not required for the core patent’s validity.
- **Severability:** If dependent claims are invalidated, the independent claims survive.

---

# **5. Emphasize the Abstract Nature of Quantum Systems**

In the background and summary sections, explicitly state that the invention treats quantum systems as **manifestations of abstract information**, not physical particles. For example:
- *“Traditional quantum computing approaches treat qubits as physical particles, leading to challenges in coherence and scalability. The present invention reframes quantum systems as manifestations of abstract information states, enabling novel methods for encoding, processing, and preserving probabilistic information.”*

**Why this works:**
- **Novelty:** This reframing distinguishes the invention from prior art, which focuses on physical implementations.
- **Theoretical Basis:** Subtly references the informational nature of quantum systems (e.g., Wheeler’s “it from bit”) without relying on speculative hypotheses.

---

# **6. Avoid Overly Specific Language**

Instead of specifying exact mechanisms (e.g., “helical lattice with 13-protofilament topology”), describe the **functional role** of the mechanism. For example:
- **Original:** *“A microtubule-inspired lattice with helical symmetry.”*
- **Revised:** *“A lattice structure configured to encode probabilistic information via geometric superpositions.”*

**Why this works:**
- **Broad Coverage:** Competitors can’t design around by using different lattice geometries, because the claim covers *any* lattice that achieves the stated function.
- **Enablement:** The detailed description can provide examples (e.g., “microtubule-inspired lattices, photonic crystals, or superconducting grids may achieve this by...”) without limiting the claim to specific structures.

---

# **Final Thoughts:**

By framing the invention as a **system for manipulating abstract information states**, you can achieve broad protection while satisfying enablement requirements. The key is to use **functional language** in the claims and provide **non-limiting examples** in the detailed description. This approach ensures that the patent covers all possible implementations (physical or otherwise) while avoiding over-reliance on specific mechanisms.
