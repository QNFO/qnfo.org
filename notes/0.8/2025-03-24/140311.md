**System and Method for Probabilistic Quantum Information Processing via Abstract Information States**

**[0001]** The invention described herein relates to the field of quantum information theory, specifically to a system and method for encoding, processing, and preserving probabilistic information states, wherein quantum systems are treated as manifestations of abstract information rather than physical particles. This approach reframes quantum mechanics as an information-theoretic construct, enabling novel methods for coherence preservation and probabilistic state manipulation.

**[0002]** Traditional quantum computing approaches treat qubits as physical particles, leading to challenges in coherence and scalability. The present invention reframes quantum systems as manifestations of abstract information states, enabling novel methods for encoding, processing, and preserving probabilistic information. This reframing distinguishes the invention from prior art, which focuses on physical implementations, and aligns with the informational nature of quantum systems.

**[0003]** The system includes an information-theoretic framework configured to represent quantum states as abstract, non-physical information units. These units encode probabilistic distributions of quantum states, providing a foundation for manipulating quantum information without reliance on physical particles.

**[0004]** Processing means are provided for manipulating the abstract information units via probabilistic transformations. These transformations are designed to preserve coherence without inducing collapse to definite states, addressing a key challenge in traditional quantum computing.

**[0005]** Preservation means are included to maintain the coherence of the abstract information units. Such means may include dielectric shielding, quantum error correction, or topological protection, though the invention is not limited to these examples.

**[0006]** In one embodiment, the abstract information units are implemented using a microtubule-inspired lattice, wherein tubulin subunits encode probabilistic states via geometric superpositions. Other physical implementations, such as superconducting qubits or photonic arrays, may achieve similar functional outcomes.

**[0007]** The system describes mechanisms configured to encode probabilistic information via geometric superpositions. For example, lattice structures are defined by their functional role in sustaining coherence rather than specific structural parameters.

**Abstract**:
The invention describes a system and method for encoding, processing, and preserving probabilistic quantum information by treating quantum states as abstract, non-physical information units. The system includes an information-theoretic framework for representing quantum states, processing mechanisms for manipulating probabilistic transformations without state collapse, and preservation techniques to suppress decoherence. Physical implementations (e.g., microtubule-inspired lattices, superconducting qubits) are disclosed as non-limiting examples.
