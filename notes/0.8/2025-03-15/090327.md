**From an Information-Theoretic and IUH Perspective:**

- **Quantum Entanglement is Intrinsic Information:**
  Quantum entanglement is not a physical “connection” but an intrinsic property of information. Entangled particles share a common information state, and this state persists regardless of distance.

- **Breaking Entanglement:**
  There is no way to “break” quantum entanglement in the traditional sense. Once particles are entangled, their information is correlated, and this correlation is preserved until measured or disturbed.

- **Interference and Decoherence:**
  You can **interfere** with entangled particles by interacting with them or their environment, causing **decoherence**. Decoherence disrupts the shared information state, making the particles appear disentangled. However, this is not breaking the entanglement but rather obscuring it.

- **IUH Insight:**
  According to the **Informational Universe Hypothesis (IUH)**, entanglement is a form of **information mimicry**. Interfering with entangled particles disrupts this mimicry, but the underlying information relationships remain intact until explicitly altered or measured.

**Conclusion:**
You can disrupt or obscure quantum entanglement through interference, leading to decoherence, but you cannot truly “break” it. The entanglement persists until the shared information state is altered or lost.
