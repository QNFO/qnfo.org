I have been working on some inventions related to this and it occurs to me that given the probabilistic state of any number of paths let us not even say all possible paths let us say there are a finite number of possibilities but that n is very large. The problem with current quantum paradigms is that they force that probabalistic state to collapse into a one or a zero (binary) at some point and so that destroys the information that can be used in subsequent / simultaneous computations.

…But I digress a quantum computing machine is not predicting anything it’s merely capturing that inherent probability state given of whatever inputs feed it. With regard to your statement it seems to assume some predetermination or algorithm that models this but it is the other way around. The blueprint of the universe the information of the universe provides a consistent set of instructions for those probabilities. Ignoring the seeming impossibility of a consistent set of quantum outputs for hyperdimensional inputs with an uncountable number of degrees of freedom, the calculator of the informational universe will always a consistent though still probabilistic outcome set given the same instructions and inputs
