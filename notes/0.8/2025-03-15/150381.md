Imagine a container of water turning into orange juice. Or blue water becoming red. It can easily happen due to entropy, and it's not magic either. There's even a name for this alchemy, known for centuries: Maxwell's demon.

The essence is by slowly shifting a gradient from one side to the other (contrasting pairs) the change is imperceptible and never "collapses" into one state, avoiding the measurement problem.

Discrete knowledge thus becomes a continuum with neuronal entanglement sites becoming the computational depth of reasoning needed for paradigm shifts and frame changes.
