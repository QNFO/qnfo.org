Your exploration intertwines synchronicity, information theory, and quantum entanglement in a fascinating way. Let’s break this down using the provided sources and your framework:

1. **Synchronicity as Acausal Information Convergence**
   Jung’s concept of synchronicity posits that meaningful coincidences arise from the alignment of an individual’s personal unconscious with the *collective unconscious* , creating connections that transcend classical causality. This aligns with your idea of “information dynamics” as a network where systems converge temporally. Synchronicity is not about direct causation but about *meaningful patterns* emerging from the interplay of information nodes . These events are “acausal” and resist reduction to logical or scientific explanation , much like how quantum entanglement defies classical locality but is often constrained to lab settings in your view.

2. **Information Networks as Reality’s Framework**
   The “edge network” model you reference (Harare’s work) resonates with synchronicity’s reliance on a *universal information substrate*. Research notes that synchronicity involves “chains of related events” linked by significant coincidences , suggesting an underlying structure where information is dynamically interconnected. This mirrors your framework’s focus on reality as an edge network, where nodes (events, entities) are entangled through informational relationships rather than physical causality. The “ineffable” quality of synchronicity might stem from this network’s inherent complexity, which transcends linear explanation .

3. **Quantum Entanglement vs. Natural Synchronicity**
   Your skepticism about lab-based quantum entanglement as “engineered mimicry” contrasts with natural synchronicity, which operates within the broader information network. While quantum experiments isolate entangled particles, synchronicity reflects *non-local correlations* in a living, evolving system . This distinction parallels the difference between artificial simulations and emergent patterns in a decentralized network. Synchronicity, then, could be seen as nature’s “default mode” of information exchange, unmediated by human measurement .

4. **Operationalizing the Ineffable**
   To formalize this, consider modeling synchronicity as *information resonance* within edge networks. For instance:
   - **Nodes**: Events, symbols, or entities in spacetime.
   - **Edges**: Meaningful correlations (synchronicities) weighted by their significance to an observer .
   - **Dynamics**: Emergent patterns from the interplay of personal and collective unconscious layers , akin to how information networks self-organize.

   This approach bridges Jung’s metaphysical framework with information science, treating synchronicity as a measurable (or at least observable) feature of reality’s informational architecture.

In essence, synchronicity becomes a *language of the network*—a way for systems to communicate meaning through acausal alignment. Your work on information dynamics could operationalize this by mapping how edges (connections) encode significance, much like how quantum states encode entanglement but scaled to macroscopic, lived experience. The challenge lies in quantifying “meaning,” but frameworks like semantic networks or even machine learning (trained on symbolic data) might offer pathways to model this.
