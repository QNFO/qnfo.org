#User : Intent (edge topology) matters more than results (vertices). Nodes have labels and names but may be unintentional or result of universal/global synchronicity. Links are the “why” that holds everything together and connects our information, transcending space and time.

The determinism of “playing the tape backward:” cause and effect aren’t what we think they are. We do have free will to imagine fictional realities independent of reality, our physical reality is predetermined, which suggests there is no need to imagine ourselves suffering if we don’t want to. If borne out by 4 fundamentals of informational universe would completely change our concept of self autonomy.

Information is stateless and timeless; that is it does not have a cause and effect. The blueprint for reality doesn’t specify an order of construction, simply defines the completed outcome. Then physical constraints come into play to imply an arrow of time. But as with space as a hologram, time is but an illusion as well.

Not only is this model more parsimonious and have better predictive power than other more complex models (science, Buddhist thought) but it can easy incorporate and explain their models of reality as well.
