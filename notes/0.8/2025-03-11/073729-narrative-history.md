Those who in their folly think that they can control the narrative of history will surely suffer a fate far worse than erasure: it will be the narrative of their opponents. Authoritarian regimes and dictatorships and those closed off to the outside will either be forgotten or remembered for what is not known and for the actions they took to censor and restrict.

There is no fairy tale of an all good reality it is far too complex and thus the good, bad the ugly should be laid bear in its full entirety and not judged by us for it is only in projecting forth to the future that we can use the lessons of history but if there is no lesson if we are selling a projected fantasy of imagination rather than learning to refine the truth of reality it is ultimately futile.
