We are going to begin drafting the narrative prose from this latest outline. To do so we will follow the recommendations for chunking the output, stopping for user prompt to continue after each chunk or section as indicated in the latest version of the outline. A consideration is that system has a limited context window that may be exceeded over the course of drafting this entire piece of writing and so in order to stay on the planned outline at the end of each chunk or section generated by the system the response will after a full draft narrative prose has been generated the system will repeat the rest of the outline in order to construct it how to proceed once the user has prompted to continue system should not attempt to generate more than one chunk as directed in the latest version of the outline at a time until the user has prompted to continue.

We will use the attached outline as the guide to proceed so be sure to keep referencing back to that to ensure staying on track. Remember that the goal is to expand and explore in narrative prose each line of the outline such that the final piece of writing has the length and depth and breadth of a graduate level textbook.
