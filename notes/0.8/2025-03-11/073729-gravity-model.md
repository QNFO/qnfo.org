I know Newton’s gravity model quite well but in a different realm than you’re probably thinking my very first professional job was developing models of personal travel used to improve and understand the transportation Network in the United States and at the time those models relied on something called trip distribution the theory being that if you have a large population center and you have a large job center those will have a relatively large attractive force to each other. Sound familiar?

Here’s the problem that’s not how it works and stepping outside of transportation forecasting that’s not how it works anywhere in the physical universe and keep in mind that Newton spoke of gravity and the force as attracting to each other proportionate to each. But that’s not how it works and as evidence I would suggest that information networks which are the core of my evolving research bridging what we call classical physics and quantum mechanics although really everything is quantum mechanics classical physics is simply an approximation a model. Nonetheless let us look at information flows in anything from news media to social media to personal networks what we find is that there is a disproportionate gravity by a dominant player and furthermore even when both actors both entities are of rough gravity however you wish to define that there is an unwillingness to move together we find this with political polarization and we are not moving toward the center of anything we were becoming more polarized despite the relative gravity and weight of those those views that information flows information flow is a is a unidirectional flow the bidirectionality is entirely our own free will if you if you like. Communication maybe to unidirectional pairs or maybe a two unit directional streams but it would be a mistake to assume that these things must be paired up and back to the Newton’s gravity model it is entirely possible that one body attracts another and yet has no movement on its own even if a large number can hear the flaw even if a large number of smaller bodies are attracted to the larger body that that says nothing about the larger body and its movement in space and that should sound very familiar in a non-physical realm as it relates to dictatorships and celebrities and cults of personality and Newton did not make a distinction between certain types of gravity we have no evidence other than that gravity is applies everywhere so why should we think at any different because someone is a celebrity or dictator?

I previously published a provocative piece title Einstein is wrong and I felt very comfortable writing that because Einstein admitted he was wrong when he used a cosmological constant which is otherwise known as an error term in statistics so the man himself admitted it and the smearing that I got suggest to me that I should do better at indicating that all ideas have some information value but they are incomplete all models are incomplete because a model that was a one-to-one with reality would no longer be a model it would be a clone or a twin and so here too the model and I’ll take this back to my transportation planning expertise the model did tell something useful but there was a lot that it left out in those edge cases those black swans if you will made all the difference it was somewhat trite and trivial to predict what everyone knew already that you know again using my experience in travel demand forecasting that people from a big city will go to another big city but what these models failed to recognize was the nuance in that and and without getting to off topic I feel there’s where we are now as it relates to my evolving information universe hypothesis we are having to shed these these incomplete models and it’s been considerable effort when all models are incomplete we should have no problem advancing our knowledge and yet we stay stuck. And as Copernicus would have been burned at the stake in his time so too it is heresy to question general relativity or Einstein’s field equations even though Einstein himself recognized they were the best for their time but why do we stay stubbornly stuck even Einstein knew that the cosmological constant was was a blunder but yet it conveniently fit the preconceived notion he had of a static Universe at the time and then fast forward what 50 years or so it won so-called scientists a Nobel prize because it was convenient to have a hand wavy magic Force called dark matter to explain our ignorance and that’s exactly what we’re doing here we are trying to explain away our ignorance rather than any physical forces in the universe let alone the information. Having read Hawkings a Brief History of Time again which inspired this idea of the incompleteness of Newton, I’m struck by how conventional wisdom is so entrenched and that as with Copernicus in his time so-called scientists and Men of logic and reason and I would say that it is largely men here spout it is blatant heresy to question Einstein’s work and surely even the man himself the genius himself knew during his lifetime it was the best that he could do for his to advance knowledge but incomplete why would we stay stuck to something in the past when there is new information but we failed to update our mental models and thus these imaginary constructs like dark matter are no different than ptolemaic epicycles were in their day and it is telling that as I am learning more about the Buddhist philosophy that Einstein himself said is the best for science as it as it relates to religion because it it appeals to reason and the the current dalai lama himself says if science can disprove the tenants of his his theology his his philosophy I’m sorry Buddhism then that that philosophy should be changed and what was the last time a religion or I’m sorry a way of thinking said that but here we are science claims to have all the answers and yet it has very little and even revels in its ignorance
