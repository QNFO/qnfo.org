# **Provisional U.S. Patent Application**

**Application Type:** Utility Patent
**Title:** *System and Method for Probabilistic Quantum Information Processing via Abstract Information States*

## **Field Of the Invention**

**[0001]** The present invention resides at the intersection of quantum information theory, bio-inspired engineering, and analog quantum computing. It introduces a paradigm shift from discrete qubit manipulation to the encoding, processing, and preservation of **probabilistic quantum information units**, wherein quantum systems are treated as manifestations of abstract information states rather than physical particles.

## **Background And Limitations of Prior Art**

**[0002]** Traditional quantum computing suffers from three key limitations:
1. **Particle-Centric Frameworks:** Qubits are treated as physical entities (e.g., trapped ions, superconducting circuits), leading to coherence challenges.
2. **Binary Constraints:** Gate-based architectures force probabilistic quantum states into discrete (0/1) outcomes.
3. **Measurement-Induced Collapse:** Observation methods destroy superposition, limiting computational utility.

**[0003]** Emerging approaches (e.g., analog quantum computing, topological qubits) partially address these issues but remain tied to physical implementations. The invention transcends these limitations by reframing quantum mechanics as an **information-theoretic construct**, aligning with Wheeler’s “it from bit” hypothesis.

## **Summary Of the Invention**

**[0004]** The invention provides a platform for **probabilistic quantum information processing** through three core innovations:
1. **Abstract Information Units:** Quantum states are represented as non-physical, probabilistic information units.
2. **Collapse-Resistant Processing:** Transformations preserve superposition via analog controls and non-demolition measurements.
3. **Bio-Inspired Preservation:** Optional embodiments leverage biological principles (e.g., microtubule dynamics) to enhance coherence.

**Key Advantages:**
- **Natural Alignment:** Mimics biological systems’ analog information processing.
- **Scalability:** Decouples quantum computation from fragile physical qubits.
- **Novelty:** Prior art lacks this integrated, information-centric approach.

## **Detailed Description**

### **1. Core Information-Theoretic Framework**

**[0005]** The system comprises:
- **Abstract Information Units:** Configurable to represent quantum states as continuous probabilistic distributions (e.g., via geometric superpositions in lattice structures).
- **Functional Equivalents:** Implementations may include microtubule-inspired lattices, photonic arrays, or superconducting qubits, but the claims are not limited to these embodiments.

### **2. Probabilistic Processing Mechanisms**

**[0006]** Processing means include:
- **Analog Controls:** Electromagnetic fields, acoustic waves, or mechanical stress modulate lattice parameters to steer state evolution.
- **Non-Demolition Measurements:** Interferometric detectors reconstruct probabilistic distributions via inverse Fourier transforms without collapse.

### **3. Coherence Preservation**

**[0007]** Preservation means leverage:
- **Dielectric Shielding:** High-permittivity materials (e.g., SrTiO₃, aqueous electrolytes) suppress decoherence.
- **Topological Protection:** Non-local encoding resists noise.
- **Dynamic Reconfiguration:** Real-time lattice adjustments compensate for environmental perturbations.

### **4. Exemplary Embodiments**

**[0008]** Non-limiting implementations include:
- **Microtubule-Inspired Lattices:** Helical tubulin arrangements with 13-protofilament topology.
- **Superconducting Networks:** Josephson junctions with phase/amplitude encoding.
- **Photonic Chiral Waveguides:** Continuous-variable state manipulation.
