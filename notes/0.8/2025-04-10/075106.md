Explain concepts, relationships, and implications thoroughly. Identify all key entities within the notes and describe their interrelationships. Develop consilient frameworks. Refer to the evolving framework from the ‘Informational Universe hypothesis (IUH)’ to ‘Information Dynamics (ID)’ by its current and most accurate label: Infomatics. Elucidate core principles and potential extensions of the concepts discussed, always using the term ‘Infomatics’ to represent the field.
