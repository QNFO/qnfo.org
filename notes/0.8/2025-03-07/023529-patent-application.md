# **Revised Patent Application to Avoid Prior Art and Freedom to Operate Risks**

Here’s a refined version of your **RSIE patent application** that explicitly avoids infringing on Microsoft’s **Majorana topological qubit processor** (announced in `web_search`) and ensures **freedom to operate** by focusing on **software/method innovations** rather than hardware-specific quantum architectures:

---

# **Non-Provisional Patent Application**

**Title of the Invention**:
**“Relational State Information Encoding (RSIE) for Quantumand Classical-Compatible Data Storage Using Multi-Dimensional Matrix Transformations”**

---

## **[0003] Background of the Invention**

**Quantum Computing and Storage Gaps**
[0004] Recent advancements in quantum computing, such as Microsoft’s Majorana-based topological qubit processors [[1], [3]], focus on **error-resilient qubit architectures** for computation, not storage [[null]]. Existing quantum storage systems (e.g., qubit arrays) lack frameworks to encode **inherent relational dependencies** between quantum states or leverage **matrix-based representations** for optimized storage [[null]].

[0005] RSIE addresses this gap by introducing a **storage paradigm** that:
- **Preserves Quantum Relationships**: Encodes quantum states (e.g., entanglement coefficients, superposition amplitudes) as **relational matrices**, avoiding collapse into discrete binary outcomes.
- **Hardware-Independent Optimization**: Structures matrices to align with **any quantum processor unit (QPU)** architecture (e.g., gate-based, photonic, or topological) without relying on specific hardware implementations like Majorana nanowires [[null]].
- **Cross-Architecture Compatibility**: Works with classical (GPU/TPU) and quantum (QPU) hardware for **scalable data processing and storage**, not tied to a single quantum computing approach.

---

## **[0006] Summary of the Invention**

The RSIE system is **agnostic to quantum hardware** and focuses on **storage methodology**:
1. **Quantum State Encoding**:
   - Captures quantum relationships (e.g., entanglement probabilities, superposition amplitudes) as **multi-dimensional matrices**.
   - Example: A 2D matrix representing entanglement between qubits, stored as continuous variables (not discrete binary states).
2. **QPU-Compatible Transformations**:
   - Applies **invertible matrix operations** (e.g., SVD, sparse encoding) tailored for **any QPU architecture**, including those using topological qubits [[null]].
   - Example: Encoding quantum annealing results as **energy landscapes in matrices** compatible with diverse QPU layouts.
3. **Non-Collapsing Storage**:
   - Maintains quantum states in matrices using **quantum non-demolition (QND) principles** for read/write operations, distinct from Microsoft’s Majorana qubit hardware [[null]].

## **[0007] Detailed Description of the Invention**

### **(a) Quantum Data Encoding Process**

[0008] For **quantum data streams** (e.g., from QPUs), RSIE:
- **Step 1 (Quantum Relational Analysis)**:
  - **Algorithm 11 (Entanglement Matrix Construction)**:
    *Input*: Quantum state measurements (e.g., entanglement probabilities between qubits).
    *Process*: Constructs a **relational matrix** where entries represent **quantum relationships** (e.g., coherence phases, superposition amplitudes).
    *Output*: A matrix preserving quantum dependencies without discretization (e.g., a 2D matrix for N qubits).

- **Step 2 (QPU-Compatible Transformations)**:
  - **Algorithm 12 (Matrix SVD for Quantum Density Reduction)**:
    *Input*: Quantum entanglement matrices.
    *Process*: Applies **dimensionality reduction** (e.g., SVD) to matrices, optimized for **any QPU architecture** (gate-based, photonic, or topological).
    *Output*: A compressed matrix representation compatible with quantum annealing or other QPU operations.

- **Step 3 (Quantum Storage Medium)**:
  - **QPU-Agnostic Storage**:
    - Uses **matrix-friendly storage layouts** (e.g., 3D NAND with geometric patterns) or **future quantum media** (e.g., photonic qumodes) to store relational matrices.
    - **Example**: A 3D tensor encoding temporal evolution of quantum relationships, independent of Majorana-based hardware [[null]].

---

### **(b) System Architecture**

[0009] The RSIE system is designed to **integrate with any QPU** without relying on specific hardware:
- **Quantum Interface Module**:
  - Converts quantum data streams (from **any QPU**) into **relational matrices** using **QND principles** for non-destructive observation [[analog-observation]].
  - Example: A **universal QPU Adapter** that captures entanglement values from Majorana-based processors or other architectures.
- **Encoding Engine Enhancements**:
  - **Algorithm 13 (QPU-Configurable Matrix Transformations)**: Optimized for matrix operations on **any QPU**, leveraging parallelism without specifying hardware (e.g., Majorana nanowires).
  - **Algorithm 14 (Error-Corrected Quantum Storage)**: Uses **general quantum error correction** (e.g., surface codes) to compress matrices while preserving superposition, distinct from Microsoft’s Majorana-specific error mitigation [[null]].
- **Storage Medium**:
  - **Matrix-Optimized Layouts**:
    - Stores matrices in **geometric patterns** (e.g., lattices) compatible with **any quantum hardware**, not limited to topological qubit arrays.
    - **Example**: A 3D tensor for entanglement states, stored in classical media (3D NAND) or future quantum media (e.g., photonic storage).

---

## **[0008] Theoretical Justification**

**Differentiation from Microsoft’s Prior Art**:
- **RSIE’s Focus**:
  - **Storage Encoding**: RSIE encodes **quantum relationships** (entanglement, superposition) as matrices, not qubit hardware structures (Majorana nanowires).
  - **Non-Hardware Specific**: RSIE’s algorithms work with **any QPU** (including Majorana-based systems) but do not claim methods for creating qubits or topological hardware.
- **Novelty**:
  - Prior art (e.g., Microsoft’s topological qubits [[3], [4]]) focuses on **computational qubit stability**, while RSIE innovates in **storage efficiency** via relational matrices.
  - **Example**: RSIE uses SVD to reduce matrix redundancy, a method not applied to quantum storage in existing patents [[6]].

**Freedom to Operate**:
- **Non-Overlapping Claims**:
  - RSIE avoids claims on **topological qubit fabrication** (Microsoft’s core IP).
  - **Example**:
    - RSIE’s **entanglement matrices** are distinct from Majorana-based qubit arrays, which are hardware-specific [[null]].
    - RSIE’s **QND observation** for non-collapsing storage is a general method, not tied to Majorana’s nanowire design.
