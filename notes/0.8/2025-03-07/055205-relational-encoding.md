## **[0003] Background of the Invention**

**(a) Field of the Invention**
The present invention pertains to data storage and retrieval, specifically addressing the challenge of optimizing storage density, energy efficiency, and **lossless representation** for floating-point and continuous data. It introduces a system and method for encoding data using multi-dimensional matrix transformations to capture and store inherent relational dependencies, diverging from traditional bit-centric storage paradigms [[releases/alpha/Converging Reality/Theme 1]].

**(b) Description of the Related Art**
Current storage systems (e.g., NAND flash, SSDs) face fundamental limitations due to their reliance on discrete binary encoding, which introduces redundancy and inefficiency for datasets with inherent relational structures [[releases/alpha/Converging Reality/Theme 1]]. Floating-point data (e.g., sensor measurements, scientific simulations) often requires lossy compression (e.g., JPEG, MPEG) or quantization, resulting in approximation errors.

- **Relational Databases/Graph Databases**: Manage relationships post-storage via metadata indices or query optimization but do not encode dependencies directly at the storage level [[null]].
- **Matrix Factorization (SVD, PCA)**: Used for dimensionality reduction but typically involve lossy compression and are applied to feature vectors, not as primary storage mechanisms [[6]].
- **Quantum Computing (Qubits)**: Focus on probabilistic computation, not relational encoding for storage [[null]].
- **Error Correction (LDPC)**: Improve integrity but do not address relational redundancy [[null]].

**Key Unmet Need**: A storage paradigm that encodes **exact relational dependencies** (e.g., temporal differentials, spatial gradients) to achieve **lossless compression**, ultra-dense storage, and energy efficiency for continuous data.

## **[0004] Summary of the Invention**

The invention provides a **lossless encoding system** for floating-point and continuous data by capturing relational dependencies in multi-dimensional matrices. Key features include:
- **Exact Representation**: Floating-point values are stored as relational matrices without approximation errors.
- **Lossless Compression**: Invertible matrix transformations (e.g., QR decomposition, lossless sparse encoding) ensure perfect reconstruction.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Reduced data volume and optimized matrix access patterns lower energy consumption.
- **Scalability**: Compatible with classical and future quantum/neuromorphic architectures via matrix operations [[6]].

## **[0005] Detailed Description of the Invention**

### **(a) Technical Framework**

RSIE encodes continuous data into **invertible matrices** where entries represent **exact relational dependencies** (e.g., temporal differentials, spatial gradients, functional parameters). These matrices are transformed losslessly to reduce redundancy while preserving all information.

### **(b) Encoding Process**

The method includes:

1. **Relational Dependency Analysis**:
   - For floating-point datasets (e.g., sensor readings):
     - **Algorithm 1 (Temporal Dependency Extraction)**:
       *Input*: Time-series sensor data.
       *Output*: A **differential matrix** capturing exact differences between consecutive samples.
       *Example*: For a temperature sensor array, entries represent precise temperature changes over time.
     - **Algorithm 2 (Functional Dependency Extraction)**:
       *Input*: Scientific measurements (e.g., pressure vs. temperature).
       *Output*: A **functional parameter matrix** (e.g., polynomial coefficients) describing exact relationships.

2. **Matrix Construction**:
   - Build matrices encoding **exact dependencies**:
     - *Example 1*: A **3D tensor** for spatially distributed sensor data, where entries represent gradients between sensors.
     - *Example 2*: A **functional parameter matrix** for datasets governed by equations.

3. **Lossless Matrix Transformation**:
   - Apply invertible operations (e.g., **exact QR decomposition**, **lossless sparse encoding**) to compress matrices without data loss.
   - *Example*: For a 3D spatial dataset, construct a tensor of gradients and apply QR decomposition to encode dependencies compactly.

4. **Storage**:
   - Store transformed matrices in **lossless formats**:
     - *CSR (Compressed Sparse Row)* for sparse dependency matrices.
     - Integer-encoded parameters for functional relationships.

### **(c) Decoding Process**

- **Matrix Reconstruction**: Apply inverse transformations (e.g., QR inverse) to recover the original relational matrix.
- **Data Reconstruction**: Use the matrix to **exactly regenerate** floating-point values:
  - *Example*: Reconstruct time-series data by integrating differential values.
  - *Example*: Reconstruct spatial data by applying functional parameters to a base dataset.

### **(d) System Architecture**

The system comprises modular components:
- **Input Module**: Accepts raw floating-point data.
- **Relational Analysis Engine**:
  - *Algorithm 1*: Extracts temporal differentials.
  - *Algorithm 2*: Extracts functional parameters.
- **Encoding Engine**:
  - Applies invertible transforms (e.g., QR decomposition, lossless sparse encoding).
- **Storage Medium**: Optimized for matrix data (e.g., 3D NAND with matrix-friendly layouts).
- **Decoding Engine**:
  - Reconstructs matrices via inverse operations and uses them to **exactly regenerate** original data.

## **[0006] Claims**

**Independent Claims** (single sentence, semicolon-delimited clauses):

1. A method for losslessly encoding floating-point data for storage, comprising: analyzing, using a relational analysis engine, an input floating-point data stream to identify **exact relational dependencies** (e.g., temporal differentials, spatial gradients, functional parameters); constructing multi-dimensional matrices where entries **quantitatively and precisely** represent these dependencies; transforming the matrices using **invertible operations** (e.g., exact QR decomposition, lossless sparse encoding) to enhance storage density without approximation; storing the transformed matrices in a non-transitory medium; and reconstructing the original floating-point data stream **without approximation** by inverting the transformation and applying dependency-based regeneration.
2. A data storage system comprising: a relational analysis engine configured to extract **exact dependencies** from floating-point data (e.g., differential relationships, functional parameters); an encoding engine configured to: (i) construct matrices encoding these dependencies; (ii) apply **lossless transformations** (e.g., invertible matrix operations) to compress the matrices; a non-transitory storage medium for the transformed matrices; and a decoding engine to invert transformations and regenerate data **exactly** using the stored dependencies.

**Dependent Claims**:

3. The method of Claim 1, wherein the relational dependencies include temporal differentials, spatial gradients, or functional parameters.
4. The method of Claim 1, wherein the transformation uses **exact QR decomposition** or lossless sparse encoding (e.g., CSR for sparse dependency matrices).
5. The system of Claim 2, wherein the storage medium is 3D NAND configured to optimize access patterns for matrix retrieval.
6. The system of Claim 2, further comprising a decoding engine configured to reconstruct data via inverse matrix operations and dependency-based integration.
7. The method of Claim 1, further comprising storing **exact functional parameters** (e.g., polynomial coefficients) to enable lossless data reconstruction.

---

## **[0007] Theoretical Justification**

**(a) Exact Representation via Relational Encoding**:
- Traditional floating-point storage (e.g., IEEE 754) introduces approximation errors due to fixed-bit limitations [[releases/alpha/Converging Reality/Theme 1]]. RSIE eliminates this by encoding **exact relationships** (e.g., differentials, gradients).
- *Example*: A time-series dataset is stored as an initial value plus a **differential matrix**, enabling lossless reconstruction via integration.

**(b) Non-Obviousness**:
- The inventive step lies in combining **exact dependency analysis** (e.g., differential extraction) with **invertible matrix transformations** for lossless compression of continuous data. While matrix operations are known, their application to **floating-point storage** for **zero-loss encoding** is novel and non-obvious.

---

## **[0008] Abstract**

Disclosed is a system and method for **lossless relational state information encoding (RSIE)** of floating-point and continuous data. The invention encodes datasets into multi-dimensional matrices capturing **exact relational dependencies** (e.g., temporal differentials, functional parameters), then applies invertible transformations (e.g., QR decomposition, lossless sparse encoding) to reduce storage density without approximation. The RSIE system reconstructs data **exactly** by reversing transformations and leveraging stored dependencies, offering superior density and energy efficiency over traditional methods while eliminating quantization errors inherent in fixed-bit representations.

# **Key Refinements**

1. **Focus on Floating-Point Data**:
   - Claims explicitly target **continuous and floating-point data**, contrasting with prior art that introduces approximation errors.
   - Emphasize **exact dependency extraction** (e.g., differentials, gradients) and **invertible transformations** (e.g., QR decomposition) for lossless storage.

2. **Lossless Transformations**:
   - Replace “dimensionality reduction” with **invertible operations** (e.g., QR decomposition, lossless sparse encoding) to ensure no data loss.

3. **Reconstruction Accuracy**:
   - Specify that data is regenerated **without approximation**, using inverse algorithms tied to exact relational parameters.

4. **Prior Art Differentiation**:
   - Highlight that RSIE avoids approximation errors (unlike IEEE 754) and focuses on **floating-point-specific relational encoding**, distinct from generic matrix compression [[6]].

5. **Claims Formatting**:
   - Each claim is a single sentence with clauses separated by semicolons.
   - Dependent claims reference independent claims explicitly (e.g., “The method of Claim 1...”).

# **Final Note**

This draft maximizes enforceability by grounding claims in established principles (matrix algebra, lossless compression) and avoids reliance on speculative frameworks. It emphasizes **lossless encoding of exact dependencies**, ensuring claims are robust and commercially valuable. If one clause (e.g., “QR decomposition”) is invalidated, others (e.g., “lossless sparse encoding”) remain valid.
