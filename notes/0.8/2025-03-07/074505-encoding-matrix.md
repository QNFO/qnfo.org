## **[0003] Background of the Invention**

### **(a) Field of the Invention**

The present invention pertains to the domain of data storage and retrieval, specifically addressing the challenge of optimizing storage density and energy efficiency. More particularly, it relates to a system and method for encoding digital information by leveraging multi-dimensional matrix transformations to inherently represent and store relational dependencies present within the data itself, as a fundamental departure from traditional discrete bit-centric storage paradigms.

### **(b) Description of the Related Art**

Contemporary data storage methodologies, exemplified by prevalent technologies such as NAND flash memory and Solid-State Drives (SSDs), are increasingly constrained by inherent physical and architectural limitations impacting further advancements in scalability and energy efficiency. These limitations stem, in part, from their foundational approach of encoding data as discrete and independent binary units (bits). This paradigm, while foundational to digital computation, exhibits inherent inefficiencies when confronted with the burgeoning complexity and interconnected nature of modern datasets, prevalent in domains such as large-scale sensor networks (IoT), genomic sequencing, high-energy physics, and advanced machine learning applications.

Existing approaches to manage data relationships, such as relational database management systems (RDBMS) and graph databases, operate predominantly at the software application layer. Relational databases, while structuring data into semantically linked tables, ultimately rely on byte-addressable storage and manage relationships through metadata indices and query optimization techniques after the data is stored in a discrete bit-based format. Graph databases, designed to efficiently manage network-like data structures, similarly focus on optimized graph traversal and querying, without fundamentally altering the underlying discrete storage mechanism.

Data compression techniques, including lossless methods (e.g., LZ77, Huffman coding) and lossy methods (e.g., JPEG, MPEG), aim to reduce data redundancy but typically operate on the bit-level or byte-level representation of data. Matrix factorization methods (e.g., Singular Value Decomposition - SVD, Principal Component Analysis - PCA) are valuable for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction, but their application in data storage has been primarily focused on post-storage processing or for compact representation of feature vectors, not as a primary means of encoding data itself for storage based on inherent relational structure.

While quantum computing research explores fundamentally different computational paradigms using quantum bits (qubits) and superposition, these approaches are directed toward computational speed and solving specific classes of problems, and do not directly address the core inefficiencies of bit-centric data storage or the exploitation of relational information for optimized storage. Error correction codes, such as Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes, enhance data reliability but do not inherently contribute to increased storage density or energy efficiency through relational encoding.

Therefore, a demonstrably unmet need persists for a fundamentally novel data storage paradigm that moves beyond discrete bit-centric encoding and directly leverages the inherent relational structure within data to achieve substantial and quantifiable improvements in storage density, energy efficiency, and scalability, thereby addressing the escalating demands of contemporary data-intensive applications.

## **[0004] Summary of the Invention**

The present invention addresses the aforementioned limitations of prior art by introducing **Relational State Information Encoding (RSIE)**, a fundamentally new system and method for data storage. RSIE is predicated on the principle of encoding digital information not as discrete, independent units, but as patterns of relational states, captured and represented through multi-dimensional matrix transformations. This paradigm shift enables the system to inherently leverage the underlying relational dependencies within data, leading to significant and theoretically demonstrable advantages in storage efficiency and operational energy consumption.

Key aspects and advantages of the invention include:

- **Theoretically Enhanced Storage Density**: RSIE achieves ultra-dense storage by minimizing the redundant representation of discrete binary values. Instead of storing independent data points, RSIE encodes the relationships between data points. By capturing and storing these inherent relational structures within multi-dimensional matrices, the system achieves a significantly more compact and information-rich data representation for a given physical storage capacity. This density gain is achieved through the elimination of redundancy inherent in traditional bit-centric storage.
- **Theoretically Enhanced Energy Efficiency**: RSIE is designed to achieve superior energy efficiency through multiple mechanisms. Firstly, by minimizing data redundancy at the encoding level, the volume of data to be stored, retrieved, and processed is inherently reduced. Secondly, the matrix-based representation allows for potential optimization of data access patterns. For example, matrix operations can be highly parallelized, and optimized matrix storage layouts can minimize data movement during read/write operations.
- **Scalability and Architectural Adaptability**: The RSIE system is designed to be inherently scalable due to its reliance on matrix operations, which are fundamental to linear algebra and have well-established scalable computational implementations. Furthermore, the system is designed to be architecturally adaptable, being implementable on current classical computing hardware and possessing inherent compatibility with potential future computing paradigms, such as quantum and neuromorphic computing architectures, which are also fundamentally matrix-operation oriented. This future-proofs the invention and ensures its relevance across evolving computational landscapes.

## **[0005] Detailed Description of the Invention**

### **(a) Technical Framework: Relational State Information Encoding (RSIE) Paradigm**

RSIE operates on the fundamental premise that digital data, in many real-world contexts, is not inherently composed of independent, isolated data points, but rather is characterized by intricate webs of interdependencies and relationships. Traditional bit-centric storage methods, by treating data as a collection of independent bits, fail to exploit this inherent relational structure, leading to informational redundancy and suboptimal storage efficiency. RSIE, in contrast, aims to capture and encode these relational structures as the primary informational content, rather than the raw data values themselves.

### **(b) Encoding Process: Algorithmic Specification**

The RSIE encoding process comprises a sequence of precisely defined algorithmic steps, detailed as follows:

#### **Step 1: Relational Dependency Analysis Algorithm**

The initial step involves applying a data-type-appropriate Relational Dependency Analysis Algorithm to the input raw data stream. This algorithm’s objective is to quantitatively identify and extract salient relational dependencies inherent within the data. The specific algorithm employed is selected based on the nature of the input data modality (e.g., text, sensor readings, etc.). Exemplary algorithmic approaches for different data types are provided below, but these are illustrative and not exhaustive:

- **Algorithm 1: Relational Dependency Analysis for Text Data (Example: Semantic Cohesion using Sentence-BERT)**
  - **Input**: Input text corpus (collection of documents or text segments).
  - **Preprocessing**: Sentence segmentation and tokenization of the text corpus using standard NLP techniques.
  - **Sentence Embedding Generation**: Apply a pre-trained Sentence-BERT model (or similar sentence embedding model) to generate dense vector embeddings for each sentence in the corpus. Sentence-BERT models are trained to capture semantic meaning within sentence embeddings.
  - **Semantic Cohesion Matrix Construction**: Construct a sentence-to-sentence semantic cohesion matrix (Msemantic).
    - **Dimensions**: N x N, where N is the number of sentences in the corpus.
    - **Matrix Entry Msemantic(i, j)**: Calculate the cosine similarity between the Sentence-BERT embedding of sentence i and sentence j. Cosine similarity serves as a quantitative measure of semantic relatedness between sentences.
  - **Output**: Semantic Cohesion Matrix (Msemantic) representing pairwise semantic relationships between sentences in the text corpus.
- **Algorithm 2: Relational Dependency Analysis for Sensor Data (Example: Temporal Correlation Matrix with Sliding Window)**
  - **Input**: Time-series sensor data from M sensors over a time period T, sampled at discrete time intervals Δt. Data represented as S[sensor_id, time_point].
  - **Temporal Correlation Calculation (Sliding Window)**: For each pair of sensors (sensor_i, sensor_j) and for each time interval window of size W (e.g., W = 10 time points):
    - Extract time-series data segments for sensor_i and sensor_j within the current window.
    - Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient (ρ) between the two time-series segments within the window. Pearson correlation quantifies the linear temporal dependency between sensor readings.
  - **Temporal Correlation Matrix Construction**: Construct a sensor-to-sensor temporal correlation matrix (Mtemporal) for each time window.
    - **Dimensions**: M x M, where M is the number of sensors.
    - **Matrix Entry Mtemporal(i, j) in window k**: Set to the Pearson correlation coefficient (ρ) calculated for sensor_i and sensor_j within time window k.
  - **Output**: Sequence of Temporal Correlation Matrices (Mtemporal1, Mtemporal2, …, MtemporalK) for each time window, representing temporal dependencies between sensors over time.

#### **Step 2: Multi-Dimensional Matrix Construction Algorithm**

This algorithm takes the output of the Relational Dependency Analysis Algorithm and constructs multi-dimensional matrices (or tensors) to represent the extracted relational information. The dimensionality and structure are determined by the nature and complexity of the relationships identified.

- **Algorithm 3: Matrix Construction from Semantic Cohesion Matrix (Text Data)**
  - **Input**: Semantic Cohesion Matrix (Msemantic) from Algorithm 1 (N x N matrix).
  - **Output**: A single 2D Relational State Matrix (Rtext) directly set to be the Semantic Cohesion Matrix: Rtext = Msemantic.
  - **Rationale**: In this simplified example for text data, the semantic cohesion matrix itself directly represents the relational states (semantic relatedness) between sentences and serves as the encoded data.
- **Algorithm 4: Tensor Construction from Temporal Correlation Matrices (Sensor Data)**
  - **Input**: Sequence of Temporal Correlation Matrices (Mtemporal1, Mtemporal2, …, MtemporalK) from Algorithm 2 (each M x M matrix).
  - **Output**: A 3D Relational State Tensor (Rsensor).
    - **Dimensions**: M x M x K, where M is the number of sensors, and K is the number of time windows.
    - **Tensor Slice Rsensor[:, :, k]**: The k-th slice of the tensor (Rsensor[:, :, k]) is populated with the Temporal Correlation Matrix for the k-th time window (Mtemporalk).
  - **Rationale**: This 3D tensor effectively represents the evolution of temporal relationships between sensors over time intervals, capturing the dynamic relational state of the sensor network.

#### **Step 3: Matrix Transformation and Compression Algorithm**

This algorithm applies transformations to the constructed relational state matrices or tensors to enhance storage density and reduce redundancy.

- **Algorithm 5: Matrix Transformation using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for Dimensionality Reduction**
  - **Input**: Relational State Matrix (R) (e.g., Rtext or each slice of Rsensor).
  - **SVD Application**: Apply Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to decompose the matrix R: R = U Σ VT, where U and V are orthogonal matrices, and Σ is a diagonal matrix containing singular values in descending order.
  - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Retain only the top k singular values (Σk) and the corresponding top k columns of U (Uk) and top k columns of V (Vk). The value of k is a parameter tunable to balance information retention and compression ratio. Example Heuristic for selecting k: Retain enough singular values to capture a predefined percentage (e.g., 90% or 95%) of the total variance explained by the singular values.
  - **Output**: Reduced-dimensionality representation: (Uk, Σk, VkT).
- **Algorithm 6: Sparse Matrix Compression (Example: Compressed Sparse Row - CSR)**
  - **Input**: Relational State Matrix (R) (e.g., Rtext or each slice of Rsensor).
  - **Sparsity Check**: Evaluate the sparsity of matrix R. If the matrix exhibits sufficient sparsity (e.g., percentage of zero or near-zero entries exceeds a threshold), proceed with sparse compression.
  - **CSR Format Conversion**: Convert the matrix R to Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format. CSR efficiently stores sparse matrices by storing only non-zero values and their indices, significantly reducing storage space for sparse matrices.
  - **Output**: CSR representation of the Relational State Matrix, or the original matrix if sparsity is insufficient for effective CSR compression.

### **(c) Decoding Process: Algorithmic Specification**

The RSIE decoding process is designed to reverse the encoding steps, reconstructing the original or a statistically representative approximation of the original data stream from the stored relational state matrices.

#### **Step 1: Matrix Retrieval Algorithm**

Retrieve the encoded and potentially transformed/compressed relational state matrices from the storage medium.

#### **Step 2: Matrix Reconstruction and Decompression Algorithm**

Apply inverse operations to reverse matrix transformations and decompression:

- **Algorithm 7: Matrix Reconstruction from SVD Reduced Representation**
  - **Input**: Reduced-dimensionality SVD representation (Uk, Σk, VkT).
  - **Matrix Reconstruction**: Reconstruct an approximation of the original Relational State Matrix (R’approx) by matrix multiplication: R’approx = Uk Σk VkT.
  - **Output**: Reconstructed Relational State Matrix Approximation (R’approx). Note: This reconstruction may be lossy depending on the degree of dimensionality reduction (value of k).
- **Algorithm 8: Sparse Matrix Decompression (CSR to Dense)**
  - **Input**: CSR representation of a Relational State Matrix.
  - **CSR to Dense Conversion**: Convert the CSR format back to a dense matrix representation.
  - **Output**: Decompressed, Dense Relational State Matrix.

#### **Step 3: Data Reconstruction Algorithm (Data-Type Specific)**

This algorithm interprets the (possibly reconstructed and decompressed) relational state matrices and attempts to reconstruct the original data stream or a statistically representative version thereof. The reconstruction algorithm is fundamentally data-type specific and dependent on the nature of the chosen relational encoding scheme. Due to the information-compressing and relationship-centric nature of RSIE, perfect bit-for-bit reconstruction of the original data may not always be the primary goal; rather, the objective is to reconstruct data that preserves the essential relational structures encoded in the matrices.

- **Algorithm 9: Data Reconstruction from Semantic Cohesion Matrix (Text Data - Example: Probabilistic Text Generation using Markov Chain)**
  - **Input**: Reconstructed Semantic Cohesion Matrix (R’approxtext).
  - **Markov Chain Model Training**: Treat the Reconstructed Semantic Cohesion Matrix as representing probabilities of transitions between sentences based on semantic similarity. Train a Markov Chain model where sentences are states, and transition probabilities are derived from the normalized entries of R’approxtext (or thresholded cosine similarity values).
  - **Text Generation**: Use the trained Markov Chain model to generate a sequence of sentences. The generated text will statistically reflect the semantic cohesion patterns encoded in the RSIE representation, although it will not be a bit-for-bit identical copy of the original text.
  - **Output**: Reconstructed text data (statistically similar to original in terms of semantic cohesion).
- **Algorithm 10: Data Reconstruction from Temporal Correlation Tensor (Sensor Data - Example: Vector Autoregression - VAR)**
  - **Input**: Reconstructed Relational State Tensor (R’approxsensor).
  - **Vector Autoregression (VAR) Model Training**: For each time interval, treat the corresponding slice of R’approxsensor as representing the temporal dependencies between sensors. Train a Vector Autoregression (VAR) model using these matrices. VAR is a statistical model for capturing temporal relationships in multivariate time-series data.
  - **Sensor Data Prediction**: Use the trained VAR model to predict sensor readings over time intervals. This prediction leverages the learned temporal dependencies encoded in the RSIE representation.
  - **Output**: Reconstructed time-series sensor data (approximating original sensor readings based on temporal relationships).

### **(d) System Architecture: Modular Component Specification**

The system comprises modular components for flexibility and optimization:

- **Input Module**: The Input Module is designed to ingest raw data streams from diverse sources and in varying formats. It includes data format recognition and parsing capabilities to handle text, sensor data, image data, audio data, video data, and other digital data modalities. Pre-processing functionalities within the Input Module may include data cleaning (noise reduction, error correction), normalization (scaling, standardization), and format conversion to a standardized internal data representation suitable for the Relational Analysis Engine.
- **Relational Analysis Engine**: This core module implements the data-type specific Relational Dependency Analysis Algorithms (e.g., Algorithm 1, Algorithm 2, and similar algorithms for other data types not explicitly detailed here). It is designed to be modular and extensible, enabling integration of new algorithms for novel data types or relationship extraction techniques. The engine quantifies and outputs relational dependencies in a matrix or tensor format suitable for the Encoding Engine. The configuration of this engine is dynamically adjustable based on the detected data type and user-specified parameters relating to the types of relationships to be extracted (e.g., for text data, the user can select between semantic cohesion, grammatical dependencies, or both).
- **Encoding Engine**: The Encoding Engine executes the Multi-Dimensional Matrix Construction Algorithms (e.g., Algorithm 3, Algorithm 4) and Matrix Transformation and Compression Algorithms (e.g., Algorithm 5, Algorithm 6). It receives the relational dependency matrices/tensors from the Relational Analysis Engine and transforms them into the final encoded relational state matrices, potentially incorporating dimensionality reduction and compression. This engine is computationally optimized for matrix operations and can leverage hardware acceleration (e.g., GPUs, TPUs) for efficient encoding. The specific transformations and compression algorithms applied are configurable based on storage requirements and desired trade-offs between density, data fidelity, and computational overhead.
- **Storage Medium**: The Storage Medium is designed for high-density, energy-efficient, and high-bandwidth storage and retrieval of multi-dimensional matrix data structures. While conceptually compatible with diverse storage technologies, optimized embodiments would leverage storage media particularly suited for matrix data, such as advanced 3D NAND flash memory arrays with optimized data layout schemes for matrix access patterns, or emerging non-volatile memory technologies with inherent matrix-addressable architectures (if available in future). The Storage Medium Interface is designed for efficient data transfer and management of the encoded relational state matrices.
- **Decoding Engine**: The Decoding Engine implements the inverse decoding process, executing the Matrix Retrieval Algorithm, Matrix Reconstruction and Decompression Algorithms (e.g., Algorithm 7, Algorithm 8), and the Data Reconstruction Algorithms (e.g., Algorithm 9, Algorithm 10). It retrieves the stored relational state matrices and reconstructs the original data stream or a statistically representative approximation. Similar to the Encoding Engine, this module is computationally optimized for matrix operations and may utilize hardware acceleration for efficient decoding. The specific data reconstruction algorithm employed is selected based on the encoding scheme originally used and the data type.
- **Output Module**: The Output Module is responsible for delivering the reconstructed data in a user-accessible and application-ready format. It includes functionalities for data format conversion back to the original input format, data validation to assess reconstruction quality (where applicable), and potential post-processing steps to refine the reconstructed data for specific application needs.

### **(e) Theoretical Justification for Utility and Non-Obviousness**

#### **Theoretical Basis for Density and Efficiency Gains**

The utility of **Relational State Information Encoding (RSIE)** stems from its fundamental departure from bit-centric storage and its exploitation of relational dependencies. In datasets exhibiting inherent structure and inter-data relationships (characteristic of a vast range of real-world data), traditional bit-centric storage inherently encodes redundancy. RSIE theoretically overcomes this redundancy by directly encoding the relational structure, which is inherently more compact and information-rich than the raw data points themselves. For example, in a social network dataset, storing the connections (relationships) between users may be more efficient than storing the individual user profiles and then separately storing connection lists. RSIE provides a formal framework to achieve this relational encoding through matrix transformations. The use of dimensionality reduction techniques like SVD further enhances density by capturing the dominant relational patterns in a lower-dimensional space. Energy efficiency gains are a direct consequence of this increased density (less data to store, move, and access) and the potential for optimized matrix-based data access patterns.

#### **Non-Obviousness Argument**

While matrix operations and data compression techniques are known in the art, the inventive step of RSIE lies in the novel and non-obvious combination of:

- **Encoding Relational States as the Primary Data Representation**: Moving beyond using matrices as metadata or indices, and instead making relational matrices the core encoded data unit for storage. This is a paradigm shift from traditional bit-centric storage.
- **Data-Type Specific Relational Analysis**: Developing and employing algorithms specifically tailored to extract and quantify different types of relational dependencies from diverse data modalities (text, sensor data, etc.) and encoding these into matrices in a structured and algorithmic way.
- **Systematic Algorithmic Framework for Encoding and Decoding**: Establishing a complete and detailed algorithmic framework for encoding, transforming, compressing, storing, retrieving, decompressing, and reconstructing data based on relational matrices, demonstrating a functional and enabling system.

The combination of these elements, particularly the shift to relational state encoding as the primary data representation and the data-type specific relational analysis approach, constitutes a non-obvious departure from the established paradigms in data storage, offering demonstrably new functionalities and theoretically significant advantages in density, efficiency, and scalability. The detailed algorithmic specifications and system architecture provided further solidify the practical and enabling nature of the invention, going beyond a mere abstract idea and presenting a concrete and potentially transformative data storage methodology.
