# Notes on Information, Computation, and Reality

## 1. Fundamentals of Information and Reality

- **The Nature of Reality:**
  - The “universe” and “reality” are a series/sequence of contrasts/states changes.
  - The real reality involves truly fundamental properties of something.
  - Proof: The sets of all math, communication, and physical matter are subsets of information as all can be represented fully in their entirety by information.
  - We can measure/observe state changes or create them.
- **Topology and Vertices:**
  - A “field” doesn’t have vertices.
  - This is where vertices meet up, snap together, that’s functionality and is also consistent with clock time.
  - Vertices are events in sequence of existence. Imagine getting hit crossing street. What if I change that time by one second either way: seems like free will even if pressured to cross street.
  - This is a topology, not a field. A web of interconnected yet independent vertices w/ existence. Perhaps unique to physical universe, this began at Big Bang. Sequences of existence, yet become dependent once two nodes snap together. The spacing in sequence is nonlinear but logically consistent. Think layers of rock or sequence of history itself.

## 2. Computing and Information Theory

- **Analog vs. Digital Computing:**
  - Instead of logic circuits relays, cards used variable current analog computing instead.
  - Why measure in binary in first place?
  - Digital ≠ Binary. Consider continuous states as discrete math. Relays incomplete.
  - Boolean algebra isn’t how nature works, so Shannon’s info theory incomplete.

## 3. Applications and Implications

- **Consumption and Learning:**
  - consider light bulbs + vacuums. What can we learn from analog computers and early developments in electronics and electricity applicable to quantum computing?
- **Entanglement and Mimicry:**
  - Entanglement = mimicry.
- **Lines and Edges in Information:**
  - Lines/edges are important informationally. No nodes topology in informational universe (part of graph theory).

The notes explore the fundamental nature of reality through the lens of information theory, topology, and computation, while also delving into practical applications and implications.
