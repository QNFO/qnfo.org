# **Non-Provisional Patent Application**

**Title of the Invention**:
**“Lossless Relational State Information Encoding for Floating-Point Data Storage Using Multi-Dimensional Matrix Transformations”**

---

## **[0001] Cross-Reference to Related Applications**

This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. [Insert Provisional Application Number], filed [Insert Filing Date], entitled “Relational State Information Encoding for Scalable and Energy-Efficient Data Storage Systems Using Multi-Dimensional Matrix Transformations,” the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.

## **[0002] Background of the Invention**

**(a) Field of the Invention**
The present invention pertains to data storage and retrieval, specifically addressing the challenge of **lossless storage** of continuous and floating-point data while optimizing density and energy efficiency through multi-dimensional matrix transformations of relational dependencies [[releases/alpha/Converging Reality/Theme 1]].

**(b) Description of the Related Art**
Current storage methods for floating-point data (e.g., IEEE 754 encoding) inherently introduce approximation errors due to fixed-bit representations [[releases/alpha/Converging Reality/Theme 1]]. While compression techniques (e.g., lossless algorithms like Huffman coding) reduce storage overhead, they still treat data as isolated values, failing to exploit relational patterns for density gains [[null]]. Matrix factorization methods like SVD are often used for dimensionality reduction, but they typically involve lossy compression. The present invention departs from these approaches by encoding **exact relational dependencies** within floating-point datasets using invertible matrix transformations, ensuring **zero-loss reconstruction**.

Prior art includes:
- Relational databases and graph databases, which manage relationships post-storage but do not encode dependencies directly at the storage level [[null]].
- Quantum computing techniques (e.g., qubit-based systems) focused on computation, not storage [[null]].
- Error correction codes like LDPC, which improve integrity but do not address relational encoding for density [[null]].

Thus, there remains an unmet need for a storage paradigm that encodes **exact relational dependencies** to achieve lossless compression and ultra-dense storage of continuous data.

## **[0003] Summary of the Invention**

The invention provides a **lossless encoding system** for floating-point and continuous data by capturing relational dependencies in multi-dimensional matrices. Key features include:

## **[0004] Detailed Description of the Invention**

**(a) Technical Framework**
RSIE encodes continuous data into **invertible matrices** where entries represent **exact relational dependencies** (e.g., differential relationships, functional dependencies). These matrices are losslessly transformed to reduce redundancy while preserving all information.

**(b) Encoding Process**
The method includes:
1. **Relational Dependency Analysis**:
   - For floating-point datasets (e.g., sensor readings, scientific measurements), identify **exact dependencies** like:
     - **Temporal correlations** (e.g., linear or nonlinear relationships between time-series points).
     - **Spatial gradients** (e.g., derivatives in spatially distributed data).
     - **Functional dependencies** (e.g., polynomial fits or differential equations governing the data).

2. **Matrix Construction**:
   - Build matrices where entries encode **exact relationships**. For example:
     - A **differential matrix** for time-series data, where entries represent precise differences between consecutive samples.
     - A **functional parameter matrix** for datasets governed by equations (e.g., coefficients of a polynomial fit).

3. **Lossless Matrix Transformation**:
   - Apply invertible transformations (e.g., **exact QR decomposition**, **lossless sparse encoding**) to compress matrices without data loss.
   - Example: For a 3D sensor dataset, construct a tensor of spatial gradients and apply invertible transforms to capture dependencies in a compact form.

4. **Storage**:
   - Store transformed matrices in **lossless formats** (e.g., compressed sparse row [CSR] for sparse matrices, or exact integer-encoded relational parameters).

**(c) Decoding Process**
- **Matrix Reconstruction**: Apply inverse transformations (e.g., QR inverse) to recover the original relational matrix.
- **Data Reconstruction**: Use the relational matrix to **exactly reconstruct** floating-point values. For example:
  - Reconstruct time-series data by integrating differential values.
  - Reconstruct spatial data by applying functional parameters to a base dataset.

**(d) System Architecture**
- **Input Module**: Accepts raw floating-point data.
- **Relational Analysis Engine**:
  - **Algorithm 1 (Temporal Dependency Extraction)**:
    Input: Time-series sensor data.
    Output: A **differential matrix** capturing exact differences between samples.
  - **Algorithm 2 (Functional Dependency Extraction)**:
    Input: Scientific measurements (e.g., temperature vs. pressure).
    Output: A **functional parameter matrix** (e.g., polynomial coefficients) describing the relationship between variables.
- **Encoding Engine**:
  - Apply invertible transformations (e.g., lossless sparse compression [[6]] or exact matrix decomposition) to encode relational matrices.
- **Storage Medium**: Optimized for matrix data (e.g., 3D NAND with matrix-friendly layouts).
- **Decoding Engine**:
  - Reconstruct matrices via inverse operations and use them to **exactly regenerate** original floating-point values.

## **[0005] Claims**

**Independent Claims**:
1. A method for losslessly encoding floating-point data for storage, comprising:
   - Analyzing, using a relational analysis engine, an input floating-point data stream to identify **exact relational dependencies** (e.g., temporal differentials, functional parameters);
   - Constructing multi-dimensional matrices where entries **quantitatively and precisely** represent these dependencies;
   - Transforming the matrices using **invertible operations** (e.g., exact QR decomposition, lossless sparse encoding) to enhance storage density without approximation;
   - Storing the transformed matrices in a non-transitory medium;
   - Reconstructing the original floating-point data stream **without approximation** by inverting the transformation and applying dependency-based regeneration.

2. A data storage system comprising:
   - A relational analysis engine configured to extract **exact dependencies** from floating-point data (e.g., differential relationships, functional parameters);
   - An encoding engine configured to:
     - Construct matrices encoding these dependencies;
     - Apply **lossless transformations** (e.g., invertible matrix operations) to compress the matrices;
   - A non-transitory storage medium for the transformed matrices;
   - A decoding engine to invert transformations and regenerate data **exactly** using the stored dependencies.

**Dependent Claims**:
3. The method of Claim 1, wherein the relational dependencies include temporal differentials, spatial gradients, or functional parameters.
4. The method of Claim 1, wherein the transformation uses **exact QR decomposition** or lossless sparse encoding (e.g., CSR for sparse dependency matrices).

## **[0006] Theoretical Justification**

**Exact Representation via Relational Encoding**:
- Traditional floating-point storage (IEEE 754) approximates values due to finite bits [[releases/alpha/Converging Reality/Theme 1]]. RSIE instead stores **exact relational parameters**, eliminating approximation errors. For example:
  - A time-series dataset can be stored as an initial value plus a differential matrix. Reconstruction integrates differentials precisely.
  - A sensor array’s spatial data is encoded as base measurements plus a gradient tensor, enabling exact spatial interpolation.

**Non-Obviousness**:
- The inventive step lies in combining **exact dependency analysis** (e.g., differential extraction) with **invertible matrix transformations** to achieve lossless compression. While matrix operations are known, their application to **floating-point data storage** for **zero-loss encoding** is novel.

## **[0007] Abstract**

Disclosed is a system and method for **lossless relational state information encoding (RSIE)** of floating-point and continuous data. The invention encodes datasets into multi-dimensional matrices capturing **exact relational dependencies** (e.g., temporal differentials, functional parameters), then applies invertible transformations (e.g., QR decomposition, lossless sparse encoding) to reduce storage density without approximation. The RSIE system reconstructs data **exactly** by reversing transformations and leveraging stored dependencies, offering superior density and energy efficiency over traditional methods while eliminating quantization errors inherent in fixed-bit representations.

2. **Lossless Transformations**:
   - Replace “dimensionality reduction” with **invertible operations** (e.g., QR decomposition, lossless sparse encoding) to ensure no data loss.

3. **Reconstruction Accuracy**:

4. **Prior Art Differentiation**:
   - Highlight that RSIE avoids approximation errors (unlike IEEE 754) and focuses on **floating-point-specific relational encoding**, distinct from generic matrix compression [[6]].
