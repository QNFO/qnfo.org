**Holographic Data Storage System Using 2D Surface Encoding of 3D Information**

# **Field Of the Invention**

[0001] This invention relates to data storage systems, specifically to holographic encoding methods that store 3D information on 2D surfaces for quantum and classical computing applications.

# **Background Of the Invention**

[0002] **Limitations of Prior Art**:
1. **Energy Consumption**: Data centers use significant electricity for cooling and maintaining 3D storage systems.
2. **Quantum Storage Gaps**: Existing quantum memory solutions (e.g., photonic qubits) are theoretical and lack practical scalability.
3. **Classical Holography**: Limited to optical storage (e.g., CDs) and fails to encode quantum or high-density classical data.

[0003] **Unmet Needs**:
- Energy-efficient storage for **quantum/classical hybrid systems**.
- Scalable 2D encoding of 3D data for cloud/quantum computing.

# **Summary Of the Invention**

[0004] **Core Innovation**:
1. 2D surface encoding stores 3D data (e.g., quantum states, molecular structures) on 2D surfaces via entanglement-based holography: $S_{\text{BH}} \propto \rho_{\mathbf{I}} \cdot A$, where
   - $S_{\text{BH}}$: Bekenstein-Hawking entropy (data density)
   - $\rho_{\mathbf{I}}$: Informational density
   - $A$: 2D surface area
2. Edge network mimicry maps 3D data to 2D using entanglement graphs ($\rho_{\text{3D}} \propto \rho_{\text{2D}} \cdot \epsilon^3$).

[0005] **Advantages**:
- Reduces data center energy use by not cooling 3D stacks.
- Enables quantum-classical hybrid storage for AI, cryptography, and drug discovery.

# **Detailed Description**

**1. 2D Surface Encoding Hardware**
[0006] Entanglement-based holography encodes 3D data (e.g., molecular structures) onto 2D surfaces using entangled photon pairs or superconducting qubits. $S_{\text{BH}} \propto \rho_{\mathbf{I}} \cdot A$ ensures maximal data density ($\rho_{\mathbf{I}}$) on minimal surface area ($A$)

**2. Edge Network Mimicry**
[0007] 3D-to-2D mapping uses edge network frameworks to compress 3D data into 2D via $\rho_{\text{3D}} \propto \rho_{\text{2D}} \cdot \epsilon^3$, where $\epsilon$ = encoding precision.

**3. Quantum-Classical Hybrid Storage**
[0008] Entanglement graphs represent quantum states (e.g., qubit superpositions) as 2D graphs, enabling seamless integration with classical cloud systems.

# **Claims**

**Independent Claims**:
1. A holographic data storage system comprising 2D surface encoding hardware for storing 3D information, wherein the hardware maps 3D data to a 2D surface via entanglement-based holography.
2. A data storage method comprising edge network mimicry to encode 3D information ($\rho_{\text{3D}}$) onto a 2D surface ($\rho_{\text{2D}}$) using the relationship $\rho_{\text{3D}} \propto \rho_{\text{2D}} \cdot \epsilon^3$.
3. A quantum-classical hybrid storage system comprising entanglement graphs to represent 3D quantum states (e.g., qubit arrays) on 2D surfaces for cloud computing applications.

**Dependent Claims**:
4. The system of claim 1, wherein the 2D surface encoding hardware uses superconducting circuits or photonic qumodes to store entangled quantum states.
5. The system of claim 2, further comprising error correction algorithms to maintain data integrity via $S_{\text{BH}} \propto \rho_{\mathbf{I}} \cdot A$.
6. The system of claim 3, configured to interface with quantum annealers or classical GPUs for hybrid computing tasks.

# **Abstract**

A holographic data storage system encodes 3D information (quantum states, molecular data) onto 2D surfaces via entanglement-based holography and edge network mimicry. The system reduces energy consumption and enables hybrid quantum-classical computing for applications in AI, cryptography, and drug discovery. Key innovations include $S_{\text{BH}} \propto \rho_{\mathbf{I}} \cdot A$ for data density and $\rho_{\text{3D}} \propto \rho_{\text{2D}} \cdot \epsilon^3$ for 3D-to-2D compression.
