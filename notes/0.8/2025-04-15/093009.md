# Part 1: Foundations and Core Mechanics

## Section 1: Introduction and motivation

### 1.1 Motivation: Cracks in the standard edifice

Contemporary fundamental physics, despite its successes, exhibits deep conceptual fissures. The incompatibility between General Relativity (GR) and the Standard Model of particle physics (SM), the persistent measurement problem in quantum mechanics (QM), and the cosmological requirement for a dominant “dark sector” (≈95% dark matter and dark energy) required to align cosmological models with observations, collectively signal potential limitations in our current understanding. Rigorous analysis of the foundations of modern physics suggests these challenges may stem, in part, from deeply embedded assumptions inherited from historical developments. Critiques of *a priori* energy quantization (originating from Planck’s mathematical resolution of the ultraviolet catastrophe), the anthropocentric biases inherent in conventional mathematical tools (base-10, linearity), and the self-referential nature of the modern SI system (which fixes constants like $h$ and $c$ by definition, potentially enshrining flawed 20th-century paradigms and hindering empirical falsification) motivate the exploration of alternative frameworks built on different first principles. Specifically, the apparent necessity for the dark sector may represent a descriptive artifact generated by applying flawed assumptions within a self-validating metrological system. This situation necessitates exploring alternative frameworks built from different first principles.

### 1.2 Infomatics: An alternative based on information and geometry

Infomatics emerged as such an alternative, proposing an ontology grounded in **information** and **continuity** rather than matter and *a priori* discreteness. It seeks to build physics from a foundation of abstract geometric principles governing an underlying informational substrate. Its goal is to provide a more parsimonious and conceptually coherent description of reality, addressing the foundational issues plaguing current models.

### 1.3 Document scope and structure (v3.0)

This document details the **Infomatics Operational Framework v3.0**, representing the current state of development translating foundational principles into a working model with testable consequences. It incorporates key findings, including the **L<sub>m</sub> Primality Hypothesis** for fermion stability (see [[#Section 7: Empirical validation: Particle properties]]).

The document is structured logically:
*   **Part 1 (Foundations & Mechanics):** Introduces motivation, axioms, the core (n, m) resonance structure, and the emergent resolution/measurement mechanism.
*   **Part 2 (Consequences & Dynamics):** Derives geometric constants/scales and outlines emergent interaction strength.
*   **Part 3 (Validation & Interpretation):** Tests against particle data (including the L<sub>m</sub> hypothesis), reinterprets quantum phenomena, gravity, cosmology, and origins.
*   **Part 4 (Synthesis & Outlook):** Summarizes the framework, advantages, and Phase 3 research goals.
*   **Appendices (Separate Files):** Provide supplementary details.

(Note: Appendix letters may change in future versions).

### 1.4 Positioning Infomatics: A unifying perspective

Understanding a new framework requires context. How does Infomatics relate to established theories like the Standard Model (SM), General Relativity (GR), String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), or Digital Physics? A comparative analysis (see external ‘Comparing Fundamental Frameworks’ BDT note) reveals Infomatics occupies a unique position by making specific core commitments:

**Information Primacy:** Like some interpretations of the Holographic Principle or Digital Physics, Infomatics posits information (as potentiality I/κ) is ontologically fundamental, not matter or spacetime.

**Fundamental Continuum:** Unlike LQG, Causal Sets, or Digital Physics, Infomatics retains a fundamental continuum (Field I), aligning conceptually with classical field theories and GR's manifold, but grounding it informationally. Observed discreteness is emergent.

**Specific Geometric Governance (π, φ):** This is a unique feature. While geometry is central to GR, String Theory, LQG, Twistors, and Geometric Algebra, Infomatics elevates the specific, dimensionless constants π (cycles) and φ (scaling/stability) to axiomatic status, governing the structure and dynamics of the informational field.

**Emergent Quantization (Rejecting h):** Unlike SM, String Theory, and standard LQG/Twistors, Infomatics rejects Planck's constant *h* and *a priori* quantization. Discreteness (particles, energy levels) emerges from stable π-φ resonance conditions within the continuous field I, governed by the geometric action scale φ.

**Derived Constants:** Infomatics aims to derive standard constants ($c$, $G$, $\alpha$) and particle properties (mass hierarchy via $M \propto \phi^m$ and $L_m$ primality) from π and φ, seeking greater parsimony than frameworks requiring numerous input parameters. (Here $\alpha$ denotes the Infomatics effective coupling).

**Emergent Gravity & Spacetime:** Like String Theory, LQG, Causal Sets, and potentially Digital Physics/Twistors, Infomatics treats gravity and spacetime as emergent phenomena arising from the underlying informational dynamics, contrasting with GR's fundamental spacetime geometry.

**Background Independence:** The framework is conceived as fundamentally background-independent, as the dynamics of the field I define the emergent spacetime structure, aligning with goals of LQG, Causal Sets, and potentially String/M-theory via AdS/CFT.

**Resolution of Anomalies:** Infomatics explicitly targets resolving the measurement problem (via contextual resolution ε), DM/DE (via modified π-φ gravity/cosmology), and singularities (via the underlying continuum) from its foundational principles.

Infomatics can thus be seen as a **meta-framework** attempting to synthesize desirable features—information primacy, geometric foundation, emergent phenomena, background independence—while making unique, falsifiable commitments (π/φ governance, emergent quantization via φ, $L_m$ hypothesis) aimed at resolving key conceptual problems and achieving greater predictive power and parsimony.

## Section 2: Foundational axioms

Infomatics provides a framework for describing reality based on principles fundamentally different from those underpinning classical materialism and standard quantum mechanics. These principles arise from identifying limitations in existing paradigms ([[#Section 1: Introduction and motivation]], [[releases/2025/Infomatics/B Crosswalk]]) and proposing a more coherent foundation grounded in information, continuity, and intrinsic geometric structure. The following three axioms, along with a necessary clarification on geometric primacy, define the ontological basis and the operational principles governing how observable phenomena emerge from the fundamental substrate of reality. *(Core terms are defined precisely in [[releases/archive/Infomatics/v3.4/D Glossary]])*.

### 2.1 Axiom 1: Foundational reality (Universal Information Field, I)
Infomatics posits that reality originates from a fundamental substrate, **Universal Information (I)**, conceived as a continuous **field** of pure potentiality. This substrate I is considered ontologically primary or co-primary, meaning it is not reducible to physical matter or energy as conventionally understood. It constitutes the fundamental background and foreground, the ultimate “possibility space” containing the latent potential (Potential Contrast, κ) for all possible distinctions and relationships. This potentiality field I is an active substrate capable of supporting structure and dynamics, governed by the principles outlined in [[#2.4 Axiom 3: Intrinsic Π-φ geometric governance]]. This explicitly non-materialist stance is motivated by challenges to physicalism and limitations of standard theories at extremes ([[#Section 1: Introduction and motivation]]).

### 2.2 Axiom 2: Manifestation via resolution of resonant contrast (Î from I via κ, ε, n, m)
Given the continuous potentiality field I (Axiom 1), governed by π and φ (Axiom 3), manifest existence arises operationally. Stable forms of existence correspond to specific **resonant patterns** within the field I – these stable configurations are the fundamental units of manifest reality and are often referred to synonymously as **waves** or **resonances** due to their dynamic and oscillatory nature governed by π and φ. These stable patterns are characterized by integer indices $(n, m)$ reflecting their cyclical (π) and scaling (φ) structure (elaborated in [[#Section 3: The (n, m) resonance structure and emergent properties]]), with the specific allowed pairs determined by underlying stability rules (Phase 3 goal, see [[#Section 7: Empirical validation: Particle properties]], [[F Lm Origin Search]]). **Manifest Information (Î)** – the general category of observable phenomena – consists of specific instances (**$\hat{\mathbf{i}}$**) corresponding to these stable $(n, m)$ resonant patterns. An instance $\hat{\mathbf{i}}$ emerges from the **potential contrast (κ)** inherent in the field I only when an **interaction** occurs. Potential contrast κ represents the underlying capacity for difference within I, allowing distinct resonant patterns (like an electron vs. a muon) to exist as separate potentialities. This interaction is characterized by a specific **resolution (ε)**, which sets the scale or granularity for distinguishability (operationally defined in [[#Section 4: Emergent resolution (ε) and measurement process]]). Manifestation occurs when the potential contrast κ associated with a specific resonant pattern $(n, m)$ is **actualized** by an interaction whose resolution ε is sufficient to distinguish that pattern. All observed discreteness (particles, quantized levels) results from this resolution process selectively actualizing specific, stable $(n, m)$ resonant modes from the continuous field I. The process is context-dependent (via ε), relational, and its probabilistic nature arises from propensities encoded in the κ landscape.

### 2.3 Clarification: The primacy of abstract geometric principles π and φ
Before stating Axiom 3, it is crucial to clarify the ontological status of the geometric constants π and φ within Infomatics. While discovered empirically through observations of physical geometry (circles, growth patterns), Infomatics asserts that π and φ are **not** fundamental *because* of these observations. Instead, π and φ represent **fundamental, abstract principles or inherent mathematical constraints governing relationships and transformations within the continuous potentiality field I itself**, prior to physical emergence. **π** represents the intrinsic principle of **cyclicity and phase coherence**. **φ** represents the intrinsic principle of **optimal scaling, proportion, and stability**. Their appearance in the physical world is considered **empirical evidence *for* their fundamental role** in governing the underlying reality I, from which physical geometry inherits its properties. This stance maintains the non-materialist foundation by asserting the primacy of these abstract geometric principles within the substrate I.

### 2.4 Axiom 3: Intrinsic Π-φ geometric governance
Infomatics posits that the **processes of interaction (parameterized by ε, [[#Section 4: Emergent resolution (ε) and measurement process]]) and the structure of the stable manifest resonant patterns (Î, characterized by indices n, m, [[#Section 3: The (n, m) resonance structure and emergent properties]]) resolved from the field I are intrinsically governed by the fundamental, dimensionless abstract geometric principles represented by π and φ**, as clarified above. These constants define the inherent geometric logic constraining *how* potentiality within I resolves into actualized patterns Î and *how* stable patterns form and relate according to cyclical (π) and scaling/stability (φ) rules. This provides the basis for the operational framework developed subsequently. *(Reference to [[releases/2025/Infomatics/B Crosswalk]] for critique of conventional math remains valid).*

### 2.5 Summary of axioms
These three foundational axioms establish the basis of Infomatics: a reality originating from a continuous, potentialist Universal Information field (I), where discrete phenomena (resonant patterns Î characterized by n, m) emerge via resolution (ε) of potential contrast (κ), all governed by the fundamental abstract geometric principles π and φ. This foundation is explicitly non-materialist, information-centric, continuum-based, and geometrically structured.

---

## Section 3: The (n, m) resonance structure and emergent properties

### 3.1 Fundamental postulate: Reality as stable Π-φ resonances

Building upon the foundational axioms ([[#Section 2: Foundational axioms]]), Infomatics proposes that **stable manifest existence (Î)** takes the form of **resonant patterns or states within the field I**. We postulate that these stable resonances, representing observable phenomena like particles and quantum states, are fundamentally characterized and distinguished by a pair of **non-negative integer indices (n, m)**. These indices arise naturally from stability conditions imposed by the underlying continuous π-φ dynamics governing the field I.

The index **n (n ≥ 0)** quantifies the **order of cyclical or phase complexity** of the resonance, intrinsically governed by the principle of **π**. It relates to the internal rotational, oscillatory, or phase structure defining the state's symmetry and spin properties. The index **m (m ≥ 0)** quantifies the **hierarchical level of scaling or structural stability** of the resonance, intrinsically governed by the principle of **φ**. It relates to the resonance's embedding within the φ-based scaling structure of reality, its complexity, and its energy/mass scale.

Only specific integer pairs $(n, m)$, determined by the (Phase 3) π-φ dynamic equations and associated **stability criteria** (potentially involving number-theoretic rules like the L<sub>m</sub> primality hypothesis for fermions, see [[#Section 7: Empirical validation: Particle properties]] and [[F Lm Origin Search]]), correspond to stable or long-lived manifest states. These allowed states form the fundamental “alphabet” or “periodic table” of reality, emerging discretely from the continuous substrate I due to resonance conditions.

### 3.2 Emergence of physical properties from (n, m) indices and topology

All intrinsic physical properties of these stable resonant states (Î) are determined *solely* by their characteristic $(n, m)$ indices and inherent **topological properties** allowed by the π-φ structure:

**Mass (M):** Determined primarily by the scaling/stability index $m$, reflecting the energy/contrast associated with that φ-level, according to the hypothesis $M \propto \phi^m$. The allowed values of $m$ for stable states appear constrained by stability rules (empirical support discussed in [[#Section 7: Empirical validation: Particle properties]]).

**Spin (S):** Determined primarily by the cyclical index $n$, with specific integers hypothesized to correspond to scalar ($n=0$), vector ($n=1$), and spinor ($n=2$) characteristics.

**Charge(s) (Q):** Emerge as conserved **topological features** (e.g., knots, twists) associated with the specific structure of the stable $(n, m)$ resonance within the field I, with charge quantization arising from the discrete nature of allowed stable topologies.

Thus, a fundamental particle is fully specified by its $(n, m, Q)$ signature within this framework.

---

## Section 4: Emergent resolution (ε) and measurement process

### 4.1 The role of interaction and resolution

Within the Infomatics framework where reality is fundamentally continuous potentiality (I/κ) structured by π and φ ([[#Section 2: Foundational axioms]]), observable, discrete phenomena (Î) only arise through **interaction**. An interaction is characterized by its ability to **resolve** potential contrast (κ) into manifest information (Î). This resolution capability is not infinite but is limited by the nature of the interaction itself.

### 4.2 Emergent resolution (ε) and the holographic justification

The concept of **Resolution (ε)** becomes an **emergent description** of the limitations inherent in any specific physical **interaction process**. An interaction (itself a transition involving specific $(n, m)$ states acting as probe and apparatus) possesses a limited capability to distinguish between, or cause transitions involving, different target $(n, m)$ states.

The **mathematical structure** of this emergent resolution limit, ε, can be understood and justified via the **optical holography analogy** (see [[releases/2025/Infomatics/B Crosswalk]] for details). The physical limits in recording continuous light waves—resolving fine phase details (π-cycles) and amplitude/contrast variations (φ-scaling/stability)—provide a strong physical basis for characterizing interaction limits. Extrapolating this, Infomatics proposes that the effective resolution ε of *any* interaction probing the π-φ structured reality naturally takes the form:

$$ \varepsilon \approx \pi^{-n_{interaction}} \cdot \phi^{m_{interaction}} $$

Here, $n_{interaction}$ and $m_{interaction}$ are non-negative integers characterizing the **interaction process itself** – its intrinsic ability to resolve cyclical/phase structure (quantified by $n_{interaction}$) and the stability/scaling level (quantified by $m_{interaction}$) at which it operates. An interaction with resolution ε can only reliably distinguish or actualize resonant states $(n, m)$ whose structural features are effectively “larger” or “coarser” than this limit.

### 4.3 Measurement as resolution of contrast (no collapse)

This resolves the measurement problem in quantum mechanics (see [[#Section 8: Reinterpreting quantum phenomena]]) by understanding measurement as an **interaction process leading to κ-resolution**, eliminating the need for wavefunction collapse. An apparatus, characterized by its operational **resolution (ε)**, probes the potential contrast (κ) landscape within I associated with possible $(n, m)$ states of the system. This interaction forces the continuous potentiality to resolve into a specific, discrete **manifest informational pattern (Î)** – an actualized contrast κ corresponding to a definite $(n, m)$ outcome – distinguishable *at that resolution ε*. The definite outcome emerges relative to the interaction context (the specific $(n, m)$ properties probed). Probabilism arises from varying propensities encoded in the κ landscape for different $(n, m)$ states, with the finite-ε interaction actualizing one outcome based on these propensities (calculable via the geometric amplitude $\mathcal{A}$, [[#Section 6: Emergent interaction strength]]). Measurement is an objective physical process of information actualization within the continuous field I, limited by the interaction's resolution ε.

# Part 2: Geometric Consequences & Dynamics

---

## Section 5: Geometric constants and scales

The Infomatics framework posits that physical constants typically treated as independent inputs emerge as necessary consequences of the underlying geometric rules (π, φ) governing the informational field I ([[#Section 2: Foundational axioms]]). This section demonstrates how fundamental scales for action, speed, gravity, length, time, and mass can be derived geometrically.

### 5.1 Geometric reinterpretation of action scale and information speed

The dynamics and interactions of the $(n, m)$ resonant states ([[#Section 3: The (n, m) resonance structure and emergent properties]]) are governed by an action principle operating within the π-φ framework. This requires defining the fundamental scales based on π and φ themselves, rather than relying on potentially artifactual constants like $\hbar$ and the standard speed of light $c$.

**Fundamental Action Unit:** Action quantifies change between $(n, m)$ states. Its fundamental scale is postulated to be directly determined by the principle of scaling and stability, **φ**.
$$ \hbar \rightarrow \phi $$
This replaces Planck's constant $\hbar$ (tied to rejected *a priori* quantization) with the geometric constant φ as the intrinsic scale governing dynamics.

**Fundamental Information Speed:** The maximum speed at which changes propagate through the informational structure is determined by the intrinsic relationship between the fundamental cycle (π) and scaling unit (φ). We postulate this universal speed limit, denoted $c$ within Infomatics (distinct from the standard value), is their ratio:
$$ c = \frac{\pi}{\phi} $$
This defines the invariant speed $c$ as a derived consequence of the geometric rules.

### 5.2 Derivation of the gravitational constant (G)

Gravity ([[#Section 9: Emergent gravity]]) is viewed as an emergent large-scale geometric phenomenon arising from the collective dynamics of $(n, m)$ states, associated with a specific high-order signature (hypothesized $n=3, m=6$). Its coupling strength, G (the Infomatics gravitational constant), must be derivable from $\phi$ and $c=\pi/\phi$.

Using dimensional analysis and requiring self-consistency with the Planck scales derived from $\phi$ and $c=\pi/\phi$ (see [[#5.3 Derived Planck scales]]), we find the scaling:

$$ G \propto \frac{\pi^3}{\phi^6} $$

This result emerges consistently from the definitions $m_P = \sqrt{\phi c / G} = \sqrt{\pi / G}$ and $\ell_P = \sqrt{\phi G / c^3} = \sqrt{\phi G / (\pi/\phi)^3}$, assuming the Planck mass scales as $m_P \propto \phi^3/\pi$ (consistent with dimensional analysis) and geometric factors are order unity. *(See [[A Amplitude]] Appendix of earlier versions for detailed steps)*. The specific exponents suggest gravity relates to 3D spatial cycles (π³) and a high stability threshold (φ⁶), explaining its weakness (see [[#Section 9: Emergent gravity]] and [[C Pi-Phi Exponents]]).

### 5.3 Derived Planck scales

Combining the geometric action ($\phi$), speed ($c=\pi/\phi$), and gravitational coupling ($G \propto \pi^3/\phi^6$), the fundamental Planck scales emerge purely in terms of π and φ (assuming unity proportionality constants for simplicity):

**Fundamental Length (Planck Length):**
$$ \ell_P = \sqrt{\phi G / c^3} \rightarrow \sqrt{\phi (\pi^3/\phi^6) / (\pi/\phi)^3} \propto \mathbf{1/\phi} $$

**Fundamental Time (Planck Time):**
$$ t_P = \ell_P / c \rightarrow (1/\phi) / (\pi/\phi) \propto \mathbf{1/\pi} $$

**Fundamental Mass (Planck Mass):**
$$ m_P = \sqrt{\phi c / G} \rightarrow \sqrt{\phi (\pi/\phi) / (\pi^3/\phi^6)} \propto \mathbf{\phi^3/\pi} $$

**Fundamental Energy (Planck Energy):**
$$ E_P = m_P c^2 \rightarrow (\phi^3/\pi) (\pi/\phi)^2 \propto \mathbf{\phi\pi} $$

These define the natural, intrinsic scales for length, sequence, mass, and energy within the π-φ resonance structure.

### 5.4 Significance: Intrinsic geometric scales

This derivation demonstrates the internal consistency and explanatory potential of Infomatics. By postulating geometric origins for action ($\phi$) and speed ($\pi/\phi$), the characteristic scales governing physics emerge solely from the interplay of π and φ. This provides a potential *explanation* for the Planck scales, rooting them in information geometry rather than viewing them as combinations of potentially artifactual constants ($h$, the standard $c$, the standard $G$). The results $\ell_P \sim 1/\phi$ and $t_P \sim 1/\pi$ reinforce the distinct roles of φ (scaling/structure) and π (cycles/sequence). The resolution limit $\varepsilon \approx 1$ ([[#Section 4: Emergent resolution (ε) and measurement process]]) corresponds directly to probing these fundamental scales.

---

## Section 6: Emergent interaction strength

### 6.1 Rejecting fundamental coupling constants (α)

Standard physics employs dimensionless coupling constants (like the fine-structure constant α ≈ 1/137 for electromagnetism) which lack first-principles explanation and rely on potentially artifactual constants ($\hbar$). Infomatics proposes that **interaction strengths are not independent constants but emerge directly as calculable consequences of the underlying π-φ geometry and dynamics** governing transitions between stable resonant states (Î) characterized by $(n, m)$.

Infomatics rejects the fundamental status of α, viewing it as an effective parameter within the standard $\hbar$-based framework. Interaction strength must be derived from {π, φ, I, κ, ε} and the action scale $\phi$.

### 6.2 Interactions as transitions via geometric amplitude ($\mathcal{A}$)

Interactions are understood as transitions between stable $(n, m)$ states ([[#Section 3: The (n, m) resonance structure and emergent properties]]). The **probability amplitude** for a specific allowed transition, $(n_i, m_i) \rightarrow (n_f, m_f)$ involving mediator $(n_{\gamma}, m_{\gamma})$ (where $i, f, \gamma$ denote initial, final, and mediator states respectively), is determined entirely by the fundamental π-φ dynamics.

This amplitude, replacing standard vertex factors involving $\sqrt{\alpha}$, must be **calculated** (Phase 3 goal) using the Infomatics action principle ($S = \int \mathcal{L} d\tau dV$ with action scale $\phi$, where $\mathcal{L}$ is the Infomatics Lagrangian). The result is a dimensionless complex number, the **Infomatics Geometric Amplitude, denoted $\mathcal{A}$**, depending only on the geometric properties of the involved states (their $n, m$ indices, determined by stability rules) and the fundamental constants π and φ:

$$ A_{transition} = \mathcal{A}(n_i, m_i; n_f, m_f; n_{\gamma}, m_{\gamma}; \pi, \phi) $$

### 6.3 Hypothesized structure and scale of $\mathcal{A}$ (EM example)

Based on the action principle origin, physical requirements (conservation, covariance), and geometric/numerical arguments ([[A Amplitude]]), the structure of $\mathcal{A}$ is hypothesized as:

$$ \mathcal{A}(\dots) = (\text{Overall Scale}) \times g(\Delta n, \Delta m, ...) \times (\text{Spinor/Tensor Structure}) $$

**Overall Scale (EM Hypothesis):** For electromagnetism, iterative reasoning and geometric arguments (e.g., ratio of 2D scaling area $\sim \phi^2$ to 3D cyclical volume $\sim \pi^3$) suggest the amplitude scales as:
$$ |\mathcal{A}_{EM}| \propto \frac{\phi^2}{\pi^3} $$
*(The precise dimensionless proportionality constant requires Phase 3 calculation).*

**Relative Strength $g(\dots)$:** A dimensionless function encoding selection rules (from π-φ symmetries) and relative probabilities, depending on the change in state indices $\Delta n = |n_f - n_i|$ and $\Delta m = |m_f - m_i|$, and the properties of the mediating pattern $(n_{\gamma}, m_{\gamma})$.

**Spinor/Tensor Structure:** Factors ensuring covariance.

### 6.4 Emergent effective coupling (α) and reconciliation

The observable interaction **probability (P)** is proportional to $|\mathcal{A}|^2$, integrated over π-φ phase space factors. This yields the **Infomatics effective coupling strength (denoted $\alpha$ for electromagnetism)**. For electromagnetism, the hypothesis implies:

$$ \alpha \propto P \propto |\mathcal{A}_{EM}|^2 \times (\text{Phase Space Factors}) \propto \frac{\phi^4}{\pi^6} \approx \frac{1}{140.3} $$

This provides a potential **geometric origin for the observed strength of electromagnetism** (measured value $\hat{\alpha} \approx 1/137$) from π and φ alone. The framework predicts that rigorous calculation using action scale $\phi$ and this geometrically derived $\alpha$ will reproduce experimental results currently interpreted using $\hbar$ and the measured fine-structure constant, $\hat{\alpha}$.

**Reconciliation Mechanism:** The key is that theoretical coefficients differ between frameworks. Let $C_S$ be the coefficient calculated in Standard QED (using $\hbar, \hat{\alpha}$) and $C$ be the coefficient calculated in Infomatics (using $\phi, \alpha$) for the same process. The prediction is that the *products* match observation:
$$ \text{Observation} \approx C(\pi, \phi) \times \alpha(\pi, \phi) \approx C_S(\pi, \hbar) \times \hat{\alpha}(\text{empirical}) $$
As shown via plausibility checks ([[A Amplitude]]), the slightly different value of $\alpha$ (~1/140) vs $\hat{\alpha}$ (~1/137) can be compensated by plausible small differences between $C$ and $C_S$ arising from the distinct $\phi$-based vs $\hbar$-based dynamics.

### 6.5 Summary: Interaction strength
Infomatics operationally eliminates fundamental coupling constants. Interaction strengths emerge from state-dependent transition amplitudes ($\mathcal{A}$) calculated from π-φ dynamics using action scale $\phi$. The observed electromagnetic strength is hypothesized to arise from geometric factors ($\phi^4/\pi^6$). This enhances parsimony, pending Phase 3 derivation of stability rules, dynamic equations, and $\mathcal{A}$.

# Part 3: Empirical Validation & Phenomenological Interpretation

---

## Section 7: Empirical validation: Particle properties

A critical requirement for Infomatics is demonstrating connection to empirical reality. This section examines how observed particle properties validate the framework's core hypotheses, particularly the $(n, m)$ resonance structure ([[#Section 3: The (n, m) resonance structure and emergent properties]]), φ-scaling, and the L<sub>m</sub> Primality Hypothesis emerging from Phase 3 analysis ([[F Lm Origin Search]]). We focus on inferring rules from the most stable fundamental patterns (Î).

### 7.1 Particle mass scaling: φ-resonance and the Lm primality hypothesis

Infomatics postulates stable particles are resonant states Î characterized by $(n, m)$, with mass $M$ primarily determined by the φ-scaling/stability level $m$ via $M \propto \phi^m$ ([[#Section 3: The (n, m) resonance structure and emergent properties]]).

**Electron (e⁻):** The fundamental stable charged lepton (Spin 1/2 $\rightarrow n=2$). Assigned base stability level **m<sub>e</sub> = 2**. Motivation: $L_2 = 3$ (prime), fitting the hypothesis below. Electron $\approx (n=2, m=2, Q_{EM}=-1)$. (Here $m_e$ denotes the mass index for the electron).

**Muon (μ⁻) & Tau (τ⁻):** Unstable leptons revealing allowed excited levels. Observed ratios $M_{\mu}/M_e \approx \phi^{11}$ and $M_{\tau}/M_e \approx \phi^{17}$ imply levels $m_{\mu} = m_e + 11 = 13$ and $m_{\tau} = m_e + 17 = 19$. (Here $m_\mu, m_\tau$ denote the mass indices, $M_e, M_\mu, M_\tau$ the masses).

**Lucas Number Connection & Hypothesis:** The corresponding Lucas numbers $L_2 = 3$, $L_{13} = 521$, $L_{19} = 9349$ are all **prime**. (Lucas numbers $L_m$ are the sequence 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123, 199, 322, 521... defined by $L_m = L_{m-1} + L_{m-2}$). This leads to the:
**L<sub>m</sub> Primality Hypothesis for Fermion Stability Levels:**
*Stable or metastable fundamental fermion resonances (hypothesized as n=2 states) tend to occur at scaling levels m ≥ 2 where the m-th Lucas number, L<sub>m</sub>, is prime.*
This rule precisely selects the observed lepton levels. Deriving its origin is a key Phase 3 goal ([[F Lm Origin Search]]).

**Quarks (u, d, s):**
*   Stable constituents (u, d): $M_u/M_e \approx \phi^{3.0} \rightarrow m_u \approx 4$ ($L_4=7$, prime!). $M_d/M_e \approx \phi^{4.9} \rightarrow m_d \approx 5$ ($L_5=11$, prime!). Excellent agreement. (Here $m_u, m_d$ denote mass indices).
*   Metastable strange (s): $M_s/M_e \approx \phi^{10.8} \rightarrow m_s \approx 13$ ($L_{13}=521$, prime!). Matches muon level.
*   Heavier quarks (c, b, t): Indices $m_c \approx 18$, $m_b \approx 21$, $m_t \approx 30$ correspond to *composite* Lucas numbers ($L_{18}, L_{21}, L_{30}$).
*   **Interpretation:** $L_m$ primality appears necessary for stable/metastable fundamental fermions (leptons, light quarks). Heavier quarks might involve additional stability factors (e.g., strong force context) or the rule might need refinement.

**Bosons (γ, W/Z, H):**
*   Photon (γ): $(n=1, m=0, Q=0)$. Massless mediator, rule N/A.
*   W/Z: $M_W/M_e \approx \phi^{27.1} \rightarrow m_W \approx 29$ ($L_{29}$ prime!). $M_Z/M_e \approx \phi^{27.4} \rightarrow m_Z \approx 29$ ($L_{29}$ prime!). Intriguing fit, but requires explanation for bosons ($n=1$).
*   Higgs (H): $M_H/M_e \approx \phi^{28.5} \rightarrow m_H \approx 30$ ($L_{30}$ composite). Rule N/A ($n=0$).
*   **Interpretation:** Boson stability likely follows different rules than the $L_m$ primality constraint for fermions.

**Neutrinos (ν):** Stable fermions ($n=2$?) with tiny mass. Do not fit simple positive integer $m$ scaling or $L_m$ rule. Mass origin requires Phase 3 understanding (e.g., $m=0$, negative $m$, background interaction?).

### 7.2 Spin and cyclical index (n)

The framework associates Spin with the cyclical index $n$:
*   $n=0$: Scalar (e.g., Higgs?)
*   $n=1$: Vector (e.g., Photon, W/Z?)
*   $n=2$: Spinor (e.g., Leptons, Quarks, Neutrinos?) - Subject to $L_m$ rule.
This provides a potential geometric origin for spin types, requiring Phase 3 derivation of allowed $(n, m)$ pairs and their properties.

### 7.3 Charge and topology (Q)

Quantized charges are proposed to arise from stable topological features (Q) of the $(n, m)$ resonant patterns. This naturally explains quantization without invoking compact dimensions. Deriving the specific allowed topologies and linking them to observed charges (e.g., electromagnetic charge $Q_{EM}$) is a Phase 3 goal.

### 7.4 Summary: Particle validation
The φ-scaling hypothesis ($M \propto \phi^m$), refined by the $L_m$ primality condition for fermions, shows remarkable correlation with stable/metastable leptons and light quarks. This strongly validates φ governing mass/stability via discrete, number-theoretically significant levels, while guiding Phase 3 research on deriving the rule's origin and extension/refinement. The association of spin with $n$ and charge with topology provides a coherent picture awaiting full derivation.

## Section 8: Reinterpreting quantum phenomena

Infomatics reinterprets core quantum phenomena not via *a priori* quantization ($h$), but through the dynamics of information (I/κ) governed by π and φ, using the geometric action scale $\phi$ ([[#Section 5: Geometric constants and scales]]) and emergent resolution ε ([[#Section 4: Emergent resolution (ε) and measurement process]]).

### 8.1 Emergent quantization via stable Π-φ resonances

Observed discrete values (energy levels, spin components, charge) are **emergent properties of stable resonances (Î)**. Within the continuous field I, only certain $(n, m)$ configurations, selected by **stability rules** (like $L_m$ primality for fermions, [[#Section 7: Empirical validation: Particle properties]]), are stable solutions to the fundamental π-φ dynamic equations (Phase 3 goal). Interaction at resolution ε preferentially actualizes these stable modes.

**Atomic Spectra:** Analysis of systems like Hydrogen and the Quantum Harmonic Oscillator using Infomatics substitutions ($\hbar \rightarrow \phi$, $c \rightarrow \pi/\phi$, effective geometric amplitude $\mathcal{A}$) yields the correct *structure* of discrete energy levels ($E \propto -1/k^2$ for Hydrogen principal levels, $E \propto (N+1/2)\phi\omega$ for QHO levels, where $k, N$ here are the standard principal/level quantum numbers emerging from the solution). Discreteness arises from resonance/boundary conditions in the continuous π-φ framework.

### 8.2 Superposition as potential contrast (κ) landscape

Quantum superposition describes the state of **potential contrast (κ)** within I *before* a resolving interaction. The mathematical representation maps this landscape of potentiality for different $(n, m)$ outcomes. Interference arises from the evolution of these potentialities in the continuous field I.

### 8.3 Measurement as resolution (ε) of contrast (κ)

Measurement is an interaction process ([[#Section 4: Emergent resolution (ε) and measurement process]]) characterized by resolution ε, which actualizes a specific manifest pattern Î (definite $n, m$ outcome) from the potential contrast κ. This eliminates wavefunction collapse. Probabilism arises from propensities encoded in κ, resolved by the finite-ε interaction via the geometric amplitude $\mathcal{A}$ ([[#Section 6: Emergent interaction strength]]).

### 8.4 Spin as intrinsic geometric/topological structure (n)

Spin (quantized in units of action $\phi$) represents potential contrast κ related to the intrinsic topological/geometric structure of the resonance Î, characterized by index $n$ ([[#7.2 Spin and cyclical index (n)]]). $n=2$ (fermions, subject to $L_m$ rule), $n=1$ (vectors), $n=0$ (scalars).

### 8.5 Wave-particle duality as resolution-dependent manifestation

Apparent duality reflects different manifestations (Î) of the same underlying resonance observed via interactions with different resolutions (ε). Wave-like behavior reveals κ evolution at coarse ε; particle-like behavior reflects the actualized Î at fine ε.

### 8.6 Uncertainty principle from complementarity and action scale φ

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle reflects fundamental complementarity in resolving information from the continuous field I via finite ε, governed by the **geometric action scale φ**. The commutation relation becomes $[\hat{x}, \hat{p}] = i\phi$, leading to $\Delta x \Delta p \ge \phi/2$. This signifies an intrinsic trade-off in resolving complementary aspects (like position vs momentum) from the continuum via any finite-ε interaction.

### 8.7 Summary: Quantum phenomena reinterpretation
Infomatics offers a coherent, continuum-based reinterpretation of quantum phenomena, resolving paradoxes by eliminating *a priori* quantization ($h$) and grounding physics in information dynamics (I/κ), geometric governance (π, φ), emergent resolution (ε), geometric action scale (φ), and calculable interaction amplitudes ($\mathcal{A}$).

## Section 9: Emergent gravity

Infomatics proposes **gravity is not fundamental, but an emergent phenomenon** arising from the structure and dynamics of information within the continuous field I, governed by π and φ. It leverages the geometrically derived constants $G \propto \pi^3/\phi^6$ and Planck scales ([[#Section 5: Geometric constants and scales]]).

### 9.1 Mechanisms of emergent gravity

Gravity effects arise from how manifest information (Î) influences the relational structure and dynamics within I:

**Κ-Field Gradients:** Concentrated Î creates κ-gradients influencing propagation paths, manifesting as attraction.

**Cross-Scale Correlations:** Fine-grained patterns aligning with large-scale structures in I could mediate long-range influence.

**Emergent Large-Scale Geometry:** Most formally, gravity *is* the emergent large-scale geometry of I. Its dynamics are governed by π and φ, yielding $G \propto \pi^3/\phi^6$. Einstein's field equations are reinterpreted as an effective description of how informational stress-energy (represented by $T_{\mu\nu}$) shapes this emergent geometry.

### 9.2 Interpreting geometric exponents in G

The derived scaling $G \propto \pi^3 / \phi^6$ ([[#5.2 Derivation of the gravitational constant (G)]]) carries theoretical meaning (see [[C Pi-Phi Exponents]] for details):

**π³:** Likely relates to the **three-dimensional cyclical structure** of emergent space and its rotational symmetries (SO(3)).

**φ⁶:** The high power in the denominator signifies an **extremely high stability threshold** ($m \approx 6$) associated with the emergence of the gravitational geometry, naturally explaining gravity's weakness compared to forces operating at lower $m$ levels.

### 9.3 Relation to GR and singularity resolution

**GR as Approximation:** General Relativity is viewed as a successful effective theory describing the emergent geometry at intermediate resolutions (ε). Newtonian gravity is a coarser approximation.

**Singularity Resolution:** GR breaks down near the geometrically derived Planck scales ($\ell_P \sim 1/\phi, t_P \sim 1/\pi$, corresponding to $\varepsilon \approx 1$). Singularities (Big Bang, Black Holes) are artifacts of extrapolating GR beyond its validity. They mark the transition to the underlying continuous π-φ dynamics of the field I, which remains well-behaved.

### 9.4 Addressing gravitational puzzles

**Quantum Gravity:** Unification occurs by describing QM ([[#Section 8: Reinterpreting quantum phenomena]]) and gravity from the *same* underlying π-φ informational framework, not by quantizing GR.

**Dark Matter/Energy:** Effects attributed to DM/DE are proposed consequences of applying the correct emergent π-φ gravity on large scales (see [[#Section 10: Cosmology without dark sector]]).

### 9.5 Summary: Gravity as emergent information geometry
Infomatics reframes gravity as emergent information geometry governed by π and φ. It encompasses GR as an approximation, resolves singularities via the underlying continuum, derives G geometrically, and offers pathways to unification and resolving cosmological puzzles.

## Section 10: Cosmology without dark sector

Standard cosmology (ΛCDM) requires Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (Λ), potentially artifacts of applying flawed theories/constants. Infomatics aims to explain observations parsimoniously using emergent π-φ gravity ($G \propto \pi^3/\phi^6$, [[#Section 9: Emergent gravity]]) and geometric constants ($c=\pi/\phi$, [[#Section 5: Geometric constants and scales]]) without DM/DE.

### 10.1 Π-φ gravity and cosmic expansion

The Friedmann equation describing the expansion rate $H$ (Hubble parameter) is modified by the Infomatics gravitational constant $G$ and informational density $\rho$:
$$ H^2 \approx \frac{8\pi G}{3} \rho \propto \frac{\pi^4}{\phi^6} \rho $$
Basic expansion histories can be reproduced, but explaining acceleration requires exploring mechanisms inherent to the π-φ framework.

### 10.2 Resolving dark matter (galactic dynamics)

Flat galactic rotation curves, the primary evidence for DM, are attributed to applying incorrect (Newtonian/GR) gravity. Infomatics predicts that applying the full **emergent π-φ gravity** ([[#Section 9: Emergent gravity]]), which inherently differs from GR and respects galactic cyclical dynamics (π) and potential scale-dependence (φ) or non-linearities, will reproduce observed rotation curves using only baryonic matter. The “missing mass” is an artifact of using the wrong gravitational theory. (Phase 3 calculation goal).

### 10.3 Resolving dark energy (cosmic acceleration)

Apparent acceleration from Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) data is challenged:

**Revised Distance-Redshift Relation:** Propagation of Î at $c=\pi/\phi$ through the emergent, inhomogeneous π-φ spacetime must be recalculated. The standard redshift ($z$) vs luminosity distance ($d_L$) relation is likely incorrect, potentially explaining SNe dimming without acceleration. (Note: $d_L$ is standard cosmological notation).

**Intrinsic Acceleration Mechanisms:** Even if acceleration is real, the modified π-φ Friedmann equation offers possibilities beyond an ad-hoc cosmological constant Λ:
*   Non-standard evolution of the informational density $\rho$.
*   A naturally derived π-φ vacuum energy (e.g., $\rho_{vac} \propto E_P / \ell_P^3 \sim \pi\phi^4$) without the standard $10^{120}$ problem.
*   Intrinsic acceleration terms in the full π-φ gravitational dynamics at low densities.
Infomatics predicts these factors will explain observations without Λ. (Phase 3 calculation goal).

### 10.4 Consistency with BBN and CMB

Consistency requires:
*   Correct expansion rate $H$ from the modified Friedmann equation.
*   Correct particle interaction rates from the geometric amplitude ($\mathcal{A}$, [[#Section 6: Emergent interaction strength]]) for Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN).
*   Emergence of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) thermal spectrum from initial state of I.
*   Reproduction of CMB anisotropies via evolution of initial κ-fluctuations under π-φ gravity (no DM/DE).
Achieving this requires detailed Phase 3 calculations.

### 10.5 Summary: Cosmological implications
Infomatics offers a parsimonious framework potentially resolving DM/DE as artifacts of applying standard gravity/cosmology. By using emergent π-φ gravity derived from geometric principles, it provides concrete mechanisms to explain galactic and cosmic dynamics, pending quantitative verification (Phase 3).

---

## Section 11: Interpreting the origin event

Standard cosmology's Big Bang singularity signals the breakdown of GR. Infomatics, based on a continuous field I governed by π and φ, resolves this artifact and reframes cosmic origins as a threshold phenomenon defined by the geometrically derived Planck scales ([[#Section 5: Geometric constants and scales]]).

### 11.1 Resolving the singularity at Π-φ scales

The Big Bang singularity is an **artifact of extrapolating emergent GR beyond its validity**. GR fails as scales approach the fundamental Infomatics limits $\ell_P \sim 1/\phi$ and $t_P \sim 1/\pi$ (where resolution $\varepsilon \approx 1$). At this limit, the underlying continuous π-φ dynamics of the field I take over, remaining well-behaved. The singularity marks the failure of the *description*, not the underlying reality.

### 11.2 Hypothesis A: A dynamic transition within Universal Information (I)

The origin event could be a **significant, objective dynamic transition within I** near $t_P \sim 1/\pi$. An eternal I undergoes a change (like a phase transition) triggered by internal π-φ dynamics, establishing the conditions (symmetries, κ-structure, initial ε) for our observable universe and its specific $(n, m)$ resonant patterns to emerge. “Before” refers to a prior dynamic state of I. Initial conditions are consequences of this non-singular transition.

### 11.3 Hypothesis B: Static holograph and the observational resolution threshold

Alternatively, I might be **static/eternal, containing potential information (κ) for all sequences simultaneously**. The “Big Bang” is the limit of our observational resolution (ε) as we trace sequences back towards $t_P \sim 1/\pi$. “Before” is inaccessible potentiality below our ε. Observation actualizes a consistent history from the eternal potential. The origin is primarily epistemological – a limit imposed by interaction near the fundamental π-φ scales.

### 11.4 Synthesis and implications for origins
Both hypotheses resolve the singularity by invoking the underlying continuous π-φ dynamics at the geometric Planck scale. Hypothesis A posits an objective event within I; Hypothesis B emphasizes the role of resolution accessing an eternal I. Distinguishing them requires further theoretical development and potential observational signatures (Phase 3). Both frame origins within continuous information geometry, moving beyond classical singularities.

### 12.4 Phase 3 outlook: Quantitative derivation and validation

The critical next stage is **Phase 3 - Quantitative Derivation and Verification**, transforming the operational framework into a fully predictive theory. The refined research program (informed by [[F Lm Origin Search]]) prioritizes:

1.  **Derive (n, m) Stability Rules:**
    *   **Primary Goal:** Derive the **L<sub>m</sub> Primality Hypothesis** for fermions ($n=2$) from first principles (φ-based geometry/topology/dynamics).
    *   Develop stability criteria for bosons ($n=0, 1$).
    *   Determine coupling rules between $n, m$ and topological rules for charge Q.
    *   Construct the theoretical Infomatics Particle Table.
2.  **Formulate and Solve π-φ Dynamic Equations:**
    *   Develop equations (e.g., Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}$) whose stable solutions inherently satisfy the derived stability rules (incl. $L_m$) and yield $M \propto \phi^m$.
3.  **Derive Geometric Interaction Amplitude ($\mathcal{A}$):**
    *   Calculate $\mathcal{A}(\dots; \pi, \phi)$ from the dynamics for the allowed $(n, m)$ states.
    *   Verify hypothesized scaling (e.g., electromagnetic $|\mathcal{A}| \propto \phi^2/\pi^3$) and derive selection rules.
4.  **Perform Precision Calculations:**
    *   Use $\mathcal{A}$ and $\phi$ to calculate g-2, Lamb shift, scattering, hadron masses, etc., comparing with experiment to validate elimination of $\alpha, \hbar$.
5.  **Quantitative Cosmology and Astrophysics:**
    *   Apply full π-φ gravity to fit cosmological data (SNe, CMB, BBN) and galactic rotation curves without DM/DE. Derive the Infomatics redshift-distance relation ($z$-$d_L$).
6.  **Identify Unique Predictions:**
    *   Search for novel predictions (new particles, deviations from SM/GR) for experimental tests.

### 12.5 Concluding remarks
Infomatics v3.0 offers a coherent, parsimonious operational framework with significant explanatory potential and strong empirical contact points (esp. $L_m$ hypothesis). It provides a robust foundation for Phase 3 research aimed at deriving its structure from first principles and achieving quantitative validation. Success would mark a significant shift towards a geometrically grounded, information-based understanding of fundamental reality.
