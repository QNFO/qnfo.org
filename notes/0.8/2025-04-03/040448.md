# **Potential Implications of Information Dynamics (ID) on Future Decentralized Systems**

The **Information Dynamics framework** [[File](Information Dynamics TOE.md)]—which treats information as a foundational substrate and models phenomena via existence (\( X \)), information vectors (\( \mathbf{I} \)), contrast (\( \kappa \)), sequence (\( \tau \)), and resolution (\( \epsilon \))—offers transformative implications for **decentralized systems** beyond Project Pebble [[File](180332.md)]. Below are key applications and innovations:

---
