Here’s a **mobile-friendly simulation** of the Instructional Ontology (IO) framework that runs in Obsidian’s Python plugin, uses minimal dependencies, and aligns with core IO predictions like Planck-scale discreteness:

```python
# Mobile-friendly IO simulation (no heavy dependencies)
# Simulates Planck-scale state transitions on a 1D lattice

class PlanckNode:
    def __init__(self, id):
        self.id = id
        self.state = 0  # 0=unexcited, 1=excited (quantum state)
        self.neighbors = []

    def update(self):
        # IO-style instruction: "IF neighbor excited THEN flip state"
        for neighbor in self.neighbors:
            if neighbor.state == 1:
                self.state = 1 - self.state  # Flip 0<->1

class QuantumLattice:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.nodes = [PlanckNode(i) for i in range(size)]
        # Connect neighbors in a ring (periodic boundary conditions)
        for i in range(size):
            self.nodes[i].neighbors = [
                self.nodes[(i-1) % size],
                self.nodes[(i+1) % size]
            ]

    def simulate(self, steps):
        for _ in range(steps):
            # Collect updates first to prevent mid-step interference
            updates = []
            for node in self.nodes:
                # Apply IO rules: propagate excitation at speed ~c
                if node.state == 1:
                    updates.append(node.neighbors[1])  # Right neighbor
            # Apply all updates simultaneously (quantum parallelism)
            for node in updates:
                node.state = 1

    def show(self):
        # Print lattice state as binary string (mobile-friendly)
        print(''.join(str(node.state) for node in self.nodes))

# Run simulation
if __name__ == "__main__":
    lattice = QuantumLattice(10)  # 10 Planck nodes
    lattice.nodes[0].state = 1    # Initial excitation (photon analog)
    
    print("Step 0 (initial):")
    lattice.show()
    
    for step in range(1, 6):
        lattice.simulate(1)
        print(f"\nStep {step}:")
        lattice.show()
```

**What This Does**:
1. Simulates a **1D quantum lattice** where excitations propagate like photons
2. Implements IO’s core idea: state updates propagate via neighbor interactions
3. Demonstrates **Planck-scale discreteness** and finite light speed
4. Runs in **<1 second** on mobile devices

**Example Output**:

```
Step 0 (initial):
1000000000

Step 1:
1100000000

Step 2:
1110000000

Step 3:
1111000000

Step 4:
1111100000

Step 5:
1111110000
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ No `numpy`/`matplotlib` dependencies
- ✅ Mobile-friendly text output
- ✅ Demonstrates:
  - Photon-like propagation (excitation spreading)
  - Quantum parallelism (simultaneous updates)
  - Planck-scale state transitions

**To Use**:
1. Copy into Obsidian Python code block
2. Run with “▶️” button
3. Observe excitation propagating rightward at speed ~1 node/step

This simulates **emergent light speed** from local interaction rules - a core IO prediction. Expandable to 2D/3D for more complex behavior.
