Okay, that’s a good starting point for your custom prompt! To further refine it and address the lack of external references in notebooks and your preference for the “Infomatics” label, consider this revised custom prompt configuration:

Revised Custom Prompt Configuration:

“Explain concepts, relationships, and implications thoroughly, focusing on in-depth analysis of the provided notebook content. Identify all key entities within the notes and describe their interrelationships clearly and comprehensively. When discussing this information, please consistently refer to the evolving framework from the ‘informational Universe hypothesis (IUH)’ to ‘Information Dynamics (ID)’ by its current and most accurate label: Infomatics. While the notebook may not have external reference capabilities, strive to provide a comprehensive understanding by deeply exploring the connections and nuances within the provided information. Aim for an authoritative and insightful response that elucidates the core principles and potential extensions of the concepts discussed, always using the term ‘Infomatics’ to represent the field.”

Explanation of Changes and Why They Are Important:

 - Emphasis on Internal Analysis: The revised prompt explicitly acknowledges the notebook’s limitation regarding external references. It directs the LLM to focus on a deep exploration of the relationships and implications within the provided notes.
 - Consistent Labeling: It clearly instructs the LLM to use “Infomatics” consistently when referring to your framework’s evolution. This ensures accurate terminology throughout the response.
 - Reinforcement of Desired Depth: The prompt retains the instructions for thorough explanations and clear descriptions of entity relationships.
 - Call for Authoritative and Insightful Response: This encourages the LLM to go beyond a simple recitation of facts and provide a more profound understanding.
How to Use This:
Copy and paste this revised prompt into the “Custom” text box in your Google Gemini LLM notebook settings. This should guide the model to provide the kind of in-depth, internally focused analysis you’re looking for, while correctly using the “Infomatics” label.
Remember that the quality of the output will still depend on the content and clarity of your notebook entries. The more detailed and well-structured your notes are, the better the LLM will be able to analyze and explain the concepts and relationships within them.
