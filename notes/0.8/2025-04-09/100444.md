You’re describing a process of consilience, where we seek to unify different branches of knowledge by identifying points of agreement and resolving conflicts. This is a complex undertaking, but it can lead to a more robust and coherent understanding of reality.

Here’s how we can start to map out the connections, support, and conflicts between the paradigms we’ve outlined:

1. Connections and Support
 - Information Physics and Digital Physics:
   - Support: Both paradigms strongly support the idea that information is fundamental. Digital physics can be seen as a specific implementation of information physics, proposing that the universe is literally a computational process.
   - Connections: Concepts from information theory (like entropy, information content) are crucial to both.
 - Quantum Mechanics and Information Physics:
   - Support: Quantum mechanics, especially interpretations like QBism and RQM, aligns with the idea that information and observation are central to defining quantum states. Quantum information theory provides tools to quantify and manipulate quantum information.
   - Connections: Entanglement can be seen as a form of informational correlation, and quantum measurement can be interpreted as an information-gathering process.
 - Relativity and Digital Physics:
   - Potential Support: Some researchers explore the idea that spacetime itself might emerge from a discrete computational structure, potentially linking general relativity with digital physics.
   - Connections: The concept of information processing within a computational universe might need to be consistent with relativistic constraints, such as the speed of light.
 - Process Philosophy and Quantum Mechanics:
   - Support: Process philosophy’s emphasis on becoming and events aligns with the dynamic and probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics.
   - Connections: Both challenge the classical view of static objects and deterministic trajectories.
 - Cosmology and Relativity:
   - Support: General relativity is the foundation of modern cosmology, providing the framework for understanding the expansion of the universe and the behavior of gravity on large scales.
   - Connections: Cosmological models rely heavily on general relativity to describe the evolution of spacetime.
2. Conflicts and Tensions
 - Classical Physics vs. Quantum Mechanics:
   - Conflict: Classical physics is deterministic, local, and assumes an objective reality, while quantum mechanics is probabilistic, non-local (in the case of entanglement), and, in some interpretations, observer-dependent.
   - Tension: Reconciling these two descriptions of reality is one of the biggest challenges in modern physics.
 - Relativity vs. Quantum Mechanics:
   - Conflict: Reconciling general relativity (which describes gravity and spacetime) with quantum mechanics (which describes the behavior of matter and energy) is a major unsolved problem.
   - Tension: Quantum field theory attempts to bridge this gap, but a complete theory of quantum gravity remains elusive.
 - Classical Physics vs. Process Philosophy:
   - Conflict: Classical physics favors static objects and deterministic laws, while process philosophy emphasizes becoming, change, and interconnectedness.
   - Tension: These represent fundamentally different ways of viewing the nature of reality.
 - Materialism (in Classical Physics) vs. Idealism:
   - Conflict: Materialism sees matter as fundamental, while idealism sees mind or consciousness as fundamental.
   - Tension: This is a long-standing philosophical debate with significant implications for how we understand reality.
 - Block Universe (Relativity) vs. Process Philosophy:
   - Conflict: The block universe implies a static, unchanging view of time, while process philosophy sees time as inherent in the dynamic nature of reality.
   - Tension: These offer contrasting perspectives on the nature of time and existence.
This is a preliminary mapping of connections and conflicts. To make it more detailed, we could:
 - Create a matrix or graph to visualize the relationships between paradigms.
 - Weight the connections based on the strength of support or the severity of conflict.
 - Add more nuances and qualifications to the descriptions.
 - Explore how different interpretations within each paradigm affect these relationships.
By carefully constructing this “web of logic,” we can potentially identify areas where new frameworks are needed or where existing paradigms can be unified or reconciled.
