Sure, here is a string graph network in Mermaid format that represents the findings from the provided text:

```mermaid
graph TD
subgraph Physics
PHY-GR(General Relativity)
PHY-QM(Quantum Mechanics)
PHY-THERMO(Laws of Thermodynamics)
PHY-SM(Standard Model of Particle Physics)
PHY-ENERGY(Energy)
PHY-ENTROPY(Entropy)
PHY-SPACETIME(Spacetime)
end

subgraph Mathematics
MATH-ZFC(Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory)
MATH-FOL(First-Order Logic)
end

subgraph Philosophy
PHIL-FUND(Fundamentality)
PHIL-CAUS(Causation)
end

subgraph Biology
BIO-EVOL(Evolution)
BIO-NATSEL(Natural Selection)
end

subgraph Information_Science
INFO-SHAN(Shannon Information Theory)
INFO-ENTROPY(Shannon Entropy)
end

subgraph Cosmology
COSMO-BBT(Big Bang Theory)
end

PHY-GR --> PHY-SPACETIME
PHY-GR --> MATH-ZFC
PHY-QM --> MATH-ZFC
PHY-THERMO --> PHY-ENERGY
PHY-ENERGY --> BIO-EVOL
PHY-ENTROPY --> INFO-ENTROPY
INFO-SHAN --> INFO-ENTROPY
MATH-ZFC --> MATH-FOL
BIO-EVOL --> BIO-NATSEL
COSMO-BBT --> PHY-GR
COSMO-BBT --> PHY-QM
```

This graph visually represents the entities and their relationships across different domains. It shows how concepts like Energy and Entropy bridge Physics and other fields, and how mathematical foundations like ZFC and FOL underlie Physics and Cosmology.
