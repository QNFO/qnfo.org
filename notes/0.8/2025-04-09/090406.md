You're absolutely right. I need to provide more specific and helpful insights, especially given the depth of your questions. I am still under development and learning to provide the level of specificity that complex inquiries deserve.
Let's try to extract some very concrete directions for reverse-engineering the rules, focusing on actionable steps within your areas of interest:
1.   Deeper Dive into Continuous Information Dynamics:
 * Axiomatic Foundation for Continuity:
   * Instead of starting with discrete axioms and trying to approximate continuity, develop an axiomatic system built from the ground up on continuous information.
   * This might involve novel mathematical structures beyond traditional set theory or calculus, perhaps drawing inspiration from topology or category theory.
   * The goal is to have axioms that inherently describe flow, change, and infinite precision, rather than treating them as derived concepts.
 * Geometric Information Encoding:
   * Go beyond representing individual continuous values (like pi) and focus on encoding dynamic continuous information in geometric forms.
   * Explore how geometric transformations, flows, and relationships can represent information processes.
   * This could involve differential geometry, fractal geometry, or even novel forms of geometric algebra.
 * Application to Quantum Measurement:
   * Specifically, model the measurement problem as a transition from a continuous information state (e.g., a superposition) to a discrete one.
   * Develop a mathematical formalism that describes this "collapse" not as an abrupt event, but as a continuous process of information loss or transformation.
   * This could potentially lead to new interpretations or even modifications of quantum mechanics.
2.   Refining Rule-Sets in Wolfram-Inspired Models:
 * Computational Metaphysics:
   * Systematically explore the space of possible rule-sets in cellular automata or network models.
   * Develop metrics to classify rule-sets based on the complexity and type of emergent phenomena they produce (e.g., stable patterns, chaotic behavior, self-organizing systems).
   * This becomes a form of "computational metaphysics," where you're computationally exploring different possible universes.
 * Meta-Rule Discovery:
   * Don't just look at individual rule-sets, but search for meta-rules that govern how rule-sets themselves evolve or change.
   * Can you find higher-level principles that explain why certain types of rule-sets are more likely to produce complex, stable universes?
   * This could involve evolutionary algorithms or other optimization techniques to search the space of meta-rules.
 * Connecting to Physics:
   * Attempt to map specific rule-sets or meta-rules to known physical laws or constants.
   * Can you find a rule-set that generates emergent phenomena that match the Standard Model of particle physics or general relativity?
   * This is an extremely ambitious goal, but it could provide a computational foundation for physics.
3.   Axiomatic Information-Centric Framework:
 * Primitive Information Axioms:
   * Develop a set of axioms where "information" is the primary undefined term, and everything else (space, time, matter, energy) is derived from it.
   * This is a radical approach, but it could provide a truly unified foundation.
   * Consider drawing inspiration from information theory, category theory, and constructive mathematics.
 * Information-Theoretic Cosmology:
   * Reframe cosmological concepts like the Big Bang, inflation, and dark energy in terms of information flow, processing, and storage.
   * Explore whether the universe can be seen as a giant computational process, with information as the "stuff" it's made of.
   * This could lead to new ways of thinking about the origin and evolution of the universe.
 * Consciousness as Information Collapse:
   * Investigate whether the act of consciousness can be modeled as a specific type of information collapse or state transition within an informational universe.
   * This is highly speculative, but it could provide a link between physics, information theory, and the philosophy of mind.
I've tried to make these directions more concrete and actionable. Are they closer to the level of specificity you're looking for? I'm committed to providing more helpful and insightful responses.
