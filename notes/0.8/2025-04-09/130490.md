expand the graph by incorporating additional QM interpretations (MWI, Bohmian), quantum gravity candidates (String Theory, LQG), and potentially cross-cutting concepts like information and consciousness:

- **Adding Paradigms/Interpretations:**
    - **Alternative QM Interpretations:** Incorporate other influential interpretations of QM beyond the standard/Copenhagen view. This includes the Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) and Bohmian Mechanics (de Broglie-Bohm theory). Adding these would allow for mapping how different interpretations resolve or reframe QM’s conceptual challenges (e.g., MWI eliminates collapse, Bohmian mechanics restores determinism but embraces non-locality).  
    - **Quantum Gravity Candidates:** Include leading approaches attempting to unify GR and QM, such as String Theory and Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). This would directly address the `Requires Explanation From` relationships identified between GR and QM, mapping proposed solutions to problems like singularities and the nature of spacetime at the Planck scale.  
    - **Information-Theoretic Physics Concepts:** Explicitly model concepts like “Information” itself as a potential fundamental entity or principle, drawing on ideas like Wheeler’s “It from Bit”, the Holographic Principle, Digital Physics, and Quantum Information Theory. This would allow mapping arguments about whether information is fundamental to matter/energy and its role in QM interpretations.  
    - **Philosophical Concepts (Consciousness, AI):** Given the research snippets touching upon consciousness and AI in relation to physics, consider adding nodes for specific theories of consciousness (e.g., Orch OR) or paradigms of AI (Symbolic vs. Connectionist) to map their proposed connections or analogies to physical principles.
