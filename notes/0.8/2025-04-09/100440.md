The block Universe meshes with the holographic principle in that it both emphasize the role of the observer in interpreting reality. Likewise Steven Wolfram graft-based computation acknowledges that our quantitative systems like geometry and algebra can derive from non-math or simpler systems IE relationships. But then what it doesn’t address is the code that created it and is that code dynamic or static which would seem to mesh with ideas about the Big Bang did the big bang happen as a discrete event or it represented a transition state and if it represented a transition state which is not different from a discrete event but basically did that transition state occur independent of observation or does it merely reflect our ability to resolve it through our you know our technology and measurement and then what you talk about measurement now that gets into quantum mechanics and the observer effect and the fact that this apparent collapse of a measurement state is entirely due to to our measurement and our resolution so it doesn’t reflect an objective reality at all. just like a hologram which is essentially an illusion or a perception of a reality who’s description actually is different right and furthermore the reality is encoded there all along all parts of a hologram contain information about every other part of a hologram the key is how we move through it but then then the question becomes okay if we accept the hologram analogy then that means we are not part of the hologram because you can’t observe a hologram from within a hologram at least I don’t think so. that understanding would suggest that we are an external observer and our our measurements are of some other reality we are not part of reality so that would seem to transcend godelian limits if we are navigating or interpreting somehow a different reality or a different system from the one that we are part of. which may get to the heart of the physics versus consciousness divide or the seeming divide, the transition between information states and what we perceive as physical reality (from the vantage point of observers in a different conscious reality?)

Heres something fascinating: is there anything that doesn’t depend on measurement or the observer effect? Other than our interpretation of ourselves and our existence what does that knowledge or our frameworks: what does that actually do?
