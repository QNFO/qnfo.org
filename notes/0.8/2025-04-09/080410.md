AI, Quantum Mechanics, Information Parallels

The metaheuristic here seems to be coevolution: that we as humans understand ourselves and our concept of the universe through introspection and modeling and in the case of quantum mechanics we stumbled on this idea of physical reality is an information state then later without realizing it also tried to model the human human cognition the human brain essentially neural nets in the same way without realizing at the time the link between the nascent development of quantum mechanics as a science and the nascent development of AI through neural nets and even to this day it is not widely understood that there is a link between the two in the sense that the neural nets that weâ€™re trying to model have structures called microtubules that are responsible for quantum processing and information exchange more specifically in ways that physical processes could not accomplish efficiently. And the complexity of such especially given a an information-theoretic continuum universe where all reality is a symbolic representation a holographic illusion if you will the connections between these two what we call AI and what we call quantum mechanics as information States converge closer and therefore we can we can learn we can create this feedback loop that learns that that informs both from each other
