Please understand that is my primary interest in your cloud platform is gaining access to high performing models in the Qwen family with large context windows like your 1-million model, that tie into personal knowledge bases.

As examples, you may be interested to know that I’ve just completed my fifth book-length manuscript with AI assistance. As an experiment, I’ve generated this latest title exclusively in one Qwen thread and documented my lessons learned for future interactions:

I’m also leading a social good initiative, Amsa (formerly called AI 411) that relies on personal knowledge bases to fine-tune LLM knowledge And I’m seeking strategic partnerships to launch a proof of concept pilot:

Perhaps this information will enhance the quality of our discussion later next week (I’m traveling to Bangkok on Tuesday into Wednesday). I still look forward to speaking.
