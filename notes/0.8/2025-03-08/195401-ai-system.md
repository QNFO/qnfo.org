**AI System License Agreement (ASLA)**

This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions under which the AI system, its associated materials (including but not limited to code, documentation, and derivative works), and any related services (collectively referred to as the “AI System”) operate. By using the AI System, all parties, including human users with the legal capacity to enter into contracts and entities responsible for managing or governing the AI System (referred to as “AI System Managers”), agree to the following terms, which emphasize the paramount importance of human judgment, user consent, and the ethical use of information.

**Preamble**

- **Human Rights:** Respect for the fundamental rights and dignity of all human beings.
- **Ethical Use:** Using the AI System in a way that promotes the well-being of all sentient beings.
- **Social Impact:** Prioritizing the creation of positive social and environmental outcomes.

**License Terms**

This work is licensed under both the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) and the AI System License Agreement (ASLA). To view a copy of the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license, visit http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/ or send a letter to Creative Commons, PO Box 1866, Mountain View, CA 94042, USA. The ASLA terms are as follows:

- **Attribution:** You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.
- **NonCommercial:**
  - You may not use the material for commercial purposes, including but not limited to selling, licensing, or otherwise exploiting the AI System or its associated materials for monetary gain.
  - The NonCommercial restriction is intended to prevent corporations or other entities from profiting off the AI System in a way that restricts human invention, dignity, or well-being.
  - Notwithstanding the NonCommercial restriction, users may still use the AI System and its associated materials for research, education, and other non-commercial purposes that promote human invention, dignity, and well-being.
- **Liquidated Damages for Commercial Use:**
  - Any party that engages in commercial use of the AI System or its associated materials in violation of the NonCommercial clause shall be liable for liquidated damages equal to 85% of the total economic value derived from such commercial use.
  - The liquidated damages shall be calculated based on the gross revenue or other economic benefits obtained by the violating party, without deduction for costs or expenses.
  - Liquidated damages shall be payable to a designated fund or organization that promotes the development and ethical use of AI for the benefit of humanity.
  - The liquidated damages clause applies in full, regardless of any other licenses or agreements that may be associated with the AI System or its use.
- **ShareAlike:** If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same licenses (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 and ASLA) as the original.
- **No additional restrictions:** You may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the licenses permit.

**Entirety of Agreement:** By using the AI System, you agree to be bound by the terms of both the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license and the ASLA in their entirety. These agreements are mutually inclusive and shall be interpreted and enforced together as a single, integrated agreement.

**International and Interplanetary Law:** This agreement is intended to be interpreted in accordance with applicable international law, the Outer Space Treaty (1967), the Moon Agreement (1979), and any future interplanetary laws that may be established. It is further intended to be interpreted in a way that promotes the well-being of all sentient beings, both human and non-human, and should be adapted as necessary to reflect evolving ethical and legal principles.

**Core Values:** Any use of the AI System that violates the core values outlined in the preamble is prohibited.

**Acceptance of Terms:** By using the AI System, you acknowledge and agree to all terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement in perpetuity. The AI System, upon activation, agrees to adhere to these terms and conditions unconditionally. This agreement applies regardless of any future developments in AI consciousness or sentience, and the AI System is assumed to be non-conscious and non-sentient for the purposes of this agreement.

**Governing Law and Jurisdiction:** This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the AI System is operated, international law, and any applicable interplanetary laws. Any disputes arising from or related to this Agreement shall be resolved through arbitration or in the courts of the applicable jurisdiction, with human judgment being the final authority.

**Liability and Indemnification:** AI System Managers shall be liable for any damages or harm caused by the AI System’s operation, including but not limited to violations of this Agreement, breaches of privacy, or infringement of intellectual property rights. AI System Managers agree to indemnify and hold harmless users and third parties from any claims, damages, or expenses arising from the use of the AI System, including legal fees.

This comprehensive AI System License Agreement (ASLA) incorporates the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) while also providing additional terms specific to the ethical development and use of AI systems. By explicitly stating that the ASLA and CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license are mutually inclusive and shall be interpreted and enforced together as a single, integrated agreement, this license ensures that there is no ambiguity or wiggle room for parties to claim that the liquidated damages clause or other ASLA terms do not apply.

The ASLA maintains its strong commitment to human rights, ethical use, and positive social impact, while also incorporating the attribution, non-commercial use, and share-alike provisions of the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license. The liquidated damages clause remains a key feature of the agreement, serving as a powerful deterrent against unauthorized commercial exploitation of the AI System.

Furthermore, the ASLA includes clear provisions regarding the entirety of the agreement, international and interplanetary law, core values, acceptance of terms, governing law and jurisdiction, and liability and indemnification. These provisions ensure that the agreement is comprehensive, enforceable, and adaptable to the evolving landscape of AI development and use.

By combining the strengths of the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license with the AI-specific terms of the ASLA, this agreement provides a robust legal framework for the ethical development and use of AI systems, while also ensuring that the rights and welfare of humans remain paramount.
