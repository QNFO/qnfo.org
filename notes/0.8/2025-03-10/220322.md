In an information theoretic approach to the universe like the information on Universe hypothesis the bumps and divots and unevenness of the fabric of reality makes a lot more sense because it doesn’t need to follow the consistent smooth rules of physics even it essentially boils down then to matrix mathematics so then the classical rules of Newtonian gravity gravity models then becomes like hotspots or or becomes a density matrix the thing can be overlaid on other density matrices and suddenly you no longer need these these fudge factors these these these adjustments to Einstein’s field equations because that’s not what we’re talking about here we’re talking about something that is inherently bumpy it has local minima because that’s what it is it is an information field not a physical field. Because the matrix and indeed the math behind it is that a crude approximation of the topology that we’re actually talking about and and each each vertices vertex each node they can bend and Warp while remaining interconnected with the others so these aren’t distortions these are inherent features of interconnectedness and state movement. Just like talk itself is nonlinear and so that bending and stretching half as a result of of information density. It’s in a local minima so that the the to think about how we can talk about prehistory and billions of years we know nothing about it you know that that regresses into the the background of the fabric of what we call time and so too with our local minima that that it would seem you know even though we consider every year precious now it fades and and science will tell Neuroscience will tell it that that as we go older we forget that we we remember the joys and forget many things but that is getting a bit out of out of scope at the moment other than to say that there’s plenty of support for this this warping and this this is nonlinearity think about the nodded yeah the ancient nodded rope very much epitomize that they can link those ropes together whatever those vertex is mean on those ropes is knots when you link them together now you’ve got essentially a net of of history.
