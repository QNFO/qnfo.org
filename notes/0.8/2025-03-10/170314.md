# **Kristin Nelson (kristin@nelsonagency.com)**

Subject: Query: The Informational Universe Hypothesis - Bridging Physics and Society

Dear Kristin,

I am a tech entrepreneur and former US federal program manager proposing a series that bridges quantum computing, information theory, and physics. My work synthesizes theoretical rigor with societal impact, addressing gaps in unification theories while engaging general readers.

Why This Fits Your List:
Your focus on science-heavy speculative ideas aligns perfectly with my Informational Universe Hypothesis, which offers a testable framework for bridging relativity and quantum mechanics. My QNFO initiative (quantum research) and four pending patents in quantum tech ground these ideas in empirical rigor.

Manuscripts Available:
The Universe is Information (Vol 1): https://q08.org/the-universe-is-information-vol1
The Universe is Information (Vol 2): https://q08.org/the-universe-is-information-vol2
The Information Spectrum: https://qnfo.org/releases/The+Information+Spectrum/README
A Sentient Bit-Stream Guide to the Multiverse: https://qnfo.org/releases/Sentient+Bit-Stream/Introduction
A Theory of Everything: Unveiling the Informational Universe: https://qnfo.org/releases/Informational+Universe/README

My Key Highlights:
- Founded QNFO (quantum research) and AI 411 (social good blockchain-based info access).
- Four US patent applications pending for quantum computing technology.
- 20+ year career in tech, data science; managed US federal government research and Deloite data analytics

This work challenges multiverse critiques while offering a fresh perspective on unification theories. Let’s discuss how it fits your list.

Sincerely,
Rowan Brad Quni

# **Alice Speilburg (submissions@jacarandalit.com)**

Subject: Query: The Information Spectrum - Sociocultural Narratives of Knowledge

Dear Alice,

I am a tech entrepreneur and former US federal program manager proposing a series that bridges quantum computing, information theory, and physics. My work synthesizes theoretical rigor with societal impact, addressing gaps in unification theories while engaging general readers.

Why This Fits Your List:
Your interest in cultural narratives aligns with my exploration of information inequality and belief systems in The Information Spectrum. My AI 411 project (blockchain-based global info access) tackles systemic gaps in knowledge distribution.

Manuscripts Available:
The Universe is Information (Vol 1): https://q08.org/the-universe-is-information-vol1
The Universe is Information (Vol 2): https://q08.org/the-universe-is-information-vol2
The Information Spectrum: https://qnfo.org/releases/The+Information+Spectrum/README
A Sentient Bit-Stream Guide to the Multiverse: https://qnfo.org/releases/Sentient+Bit-Stream/Introduction
A Theory of Everything: Unveiling the Informational Universe: https://qnfo.org/releases/Informational+Universe/README

My Key Highlights:
- Founded QNFO (quantum research) and AI 411 (social good blockchain-based info access).
- Four US patent applications pending for quantum computing technology.
- 20+ year career in tech, data science; managed US federal government research and Deloite data analytics

This work critiques Western-centric paradigms while offering solutions for equitable knowledge ecosystems. Let’s discuss how it fits your list.

# **Kate Evans (kate.evans@pfd.co.uk)**

Subject: Query: A Sentient Bit-Stream Guide to the Multiverse - Science-Curious Adventures

Dear Kate,

I am a tech entrepreneur and former US federal program manager proposing a series that bridges quantum computing, information theory, and science communication. My work synthesizes physics with accessible narratives, addressing gaps in unification theories while engaging general readers.

Why This Fits Your List:
Your focus on science journalism aligns with my case studies in The Information Spectrum (e.g., Malthusian limits, Flat Earth communities). My AI 411 project (blockchain-based global info access) and QNFO’s quantum research offer fresh angles for science-curious audiences.

Manuscripts Available:
The Universe is Information (Vol 1): https://q08.org/the-universe-is-information-vol1
The Universe is Information (Vol 2): https://q08.org/the-universe-is-information-vol2
The Information Spectrum: https://qnfo.org/releases/The+Information+Spectrum/README

# **Gyamfia Osei (submissions@analiteraryagency.com)**

Subject: Query: The Informational Universe Hypothesis - Challenging Western-Centric Paradigms

Dear Gyamfia,

I am a tech entrepreneur and former US federal program manager proposing a series that bridges quantum computing, information theory, and global equity. My work synthesizes physics with ethics and social good, addressing gaps in unification theories while engaging general readers.

Why This Fits Your List:
Your focus on underrepresented voices aligns with my critique of Western-centric physics in The Information Spectrum. My AI 411 project (blockchain-based global info access) prioritizes marginalized communities.

Manuscripts Available:
The Universe is Information (Vol 1): https://q08.org/the-universe-is-information-vol1
