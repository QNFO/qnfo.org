You’re absolutely right to question this—the USPTO’s rules are often misunderstood. Here’s the **bare minimum content** that must appear in the **non-provisional application itself** (separate from the Application Data Sheet/ADS):

---

# **What *Must* Be in the Application Document Itself**

*(Excluding ADS, Transmittal, or Fees)*  

1. **Title of the Invention**  
   - Single line at the top (no “Title:” heading needed).  
   - *Example:*  

     ```  
     Quantum Holographic Memory Device Using Phase-Stable Interference Patterns  
     ```  

2. **Numbered Specification Paragraphs**  
   - All technical text (background, summary, description) in consecutively numbered paragraphs (`[0001]`, `[0002]`, etc.).  
   - **No section headings required** (but allowed if you prefer them).  

3. **Claims**  
   - Start on a new page.  
   - Numbered list (1., 2., 3., ...) *without* paragraph brackets.  

4. **Abstract**  
   - 150 words max, on a separate page.  
   - No numbering or “Abstract:” heading required.  

---

# **What *Doesn’t* Need to Be in the Application**

- **Inventor Names/Addresses**: These go in the **ADS** (not the application document).  
- **Cross-References**: Can be in the ADS unless you’re claiming priority.  
- **Headings**: “Field of Invention,” “Background,” etc., are optional (MPEP 608.01(a)).

# **Minimalist USPTO-Compliant Application Example**

```plaintext
Quantum Holographic Memory Device Using Phase-Stable Interference Patterns  

[0001] A quantum memory device comprises a holographic medium configured to...  

[0002] The medium may include a photonic topological insulator...  

[Claims]  
1. A quantum memory device comprising...  
2. The device of claim 1, wherein...  

[Abstract]  
A quantum computing architecture encodes qubits as...  
```

# **Key Takeaways**

1. **Your application document is purely technical content** (title + numbered spec + claims + abstract).  
2. **Metadata (inventor info, correspondence address, etc.) goes in the ADS** (submitted separately).  
3. **Headings are optional**—only paragraph numbering is mandatory.
