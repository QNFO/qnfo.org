Phase-Encoded Information System for Unified Storage and Processing

[0001] Information storage and processing systems face inherent tradeoffs between volatility, energy efficiency, and computational universality. Conventional architectures—whether classical or quantum—require discrete state representations that impose artificial boundaries between memory and computation, necessitating error-prone state transfers and specialized hardware for each function.

[0002] The present invention transcends these limitations by exploiting the continuous phase-amplitude relationships of wave interference phenomena. By treating information as a persistent interference pattern rather than discrete states, the system achieves native unification of memory and processing capabilities within a single physical substrate. This approach leverages three fundamental physical principles: geometric redundancy for stability, nonlinear wave mixing for transformations, and material-engineered phase coherence for ambient operation.

[0003] In its preferred embodiment, the invention comprises a holographic medium that stores information as topologically protected interference patterns. A modulation interface dynamically reconfigures these patterns to perform computations through controlled phase evolution, eliminating the need for separate memory and processor components. The system operates without active error correction or cryogenic support, deriving fault tolerance from the intrinsic properties of interference dynamics rather than algorithmic redundancy.

[0004] Key innovations include: the use of phase continuity to represent probabilistic state continuums; material designs that preserve phase relationships beyond classical bit lifetimes; and reconfigurable interfaces that transition seamlessly between storage and computation modes. These advances are physically realized through nonlinear optical materials, superconducting phase gradients, or spin-wave distributions.

[0005] The specification discloses multiple embodiments, from nanophotonic crystals to macroscopic Bose-Einstein condensates, all sharing the common inventive concept of phase-encoded information processing. Manufacturing techniques include defect engineering for phase stability and lithographic patterning for interference control, enabling scalable production across quantum and classical computing platforms.

[ABSTRACT]

A unified information system encodes and processes data through persistent phase-amplitude interference patterns in a physical medium, eliminating the distinction between memory and computation. The system represents information as continuous phase relationships rather than discrete states, enabling both stable storage through geometric redundancy and active processing through controlled interference modulation.
