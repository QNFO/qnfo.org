**Non-Provisional Utility Patent Application**  

# [0001] Title of Invention

“Quantum Holographic Memory Device and Method for Phase-Stable Qubit Encoding”  

# [0002] Inventors

Rowan Brad Quni, [Your Address], [Your Email]  

# [0003] Cross-Reference to Related Applications

[If applicable, list provisional applications or prior filings under 35 U.S.C. § 119]  

# [0004] Field of the Invention

The present invention pertains to quantum information storage and processing, specifically a device and method for encoding qubits in a phase-stable interference pattern within a holographic medium, achieving fault tolerance through topological redundancy.  

# [0005] Background of the Invention

Current quantum computing architectures suffer from decoherence and scalability limitations due to their reliance on discrete qubit representations. Classical holography demonstrates robust information storage via interference patterns, but prior art fails to adapt this principle to quantum systems. The invention addresses this gap by integrating holographic phase-amplitude encoding with quantum information theory.  

# [0006] Summary of the Invention

The invention discloses a quantum memory device comprising: (1) a holographic medium configured to store qubits as interference patterns; (2) a phase-modulation system for writing/reading states via controlled wave interference; and (3) a controller implementing geometric error correction. Key advantages include intrinsic decoherence resistance and exponential qubit density scaling.  

# [0007] Detailed Description

## [0008] Quantum Holographic Medium

The medium consists of a nanostructured photonic crystal or Bose-Einstein condensate engineered to record quantum states as spatially varying phase gradients. Coherent wavefronts (e.g., laser pulses) interact with the medium to produce stable interference fringes representing qubit superpositions.  

## [0009] Phase Modulation System

A pulsed laser array encodes qubits by generating constructive/destructive interference patterns. Single-photon detectors reconstruct states by measuring phase differentials across the medium. The system operates at ambient temperature, eliminating cryogenic requirements.  

## [0010] Topological Error Correction

Quantum information is distributed non-locally across interference fringes, enabling full state recovery from partial medium degradation. An AI controller dynamically adjusts phase modulation to counteract decoherence effects.  

# [0011] Claims

1. A quantum memory device comprising:  
   a holographic medium configured to store qubits as phase-amplitude interference patterns;  
   a phase-modulation system operatively coupled to said medium; and  
   a controller implementing topological error correction.  

2. The device of claim 1, wherein the medium comprises a photonic topological insulator.  

3. A method for quantum computing comprising:  
   encoding qubits via interference of coherent waves in a holographic medium;  
   processing quantum data by modulating phase gradients; and  
   correcting errors via geometric reconstruction of interference fringes.  

4. The method of claim 3, further comprising optimizing phase modulation via machine learning.  

# [0012] Abstract

A quantum computing architecture encodes qubits as phase-stable interference patterns in a holographic medium, achieving fault tolerance through topological redundancy and enabling scalable quantum information processing.
