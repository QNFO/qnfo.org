# **Qualitative Claim Drafting Strategies**

*(Avoiding Numerical Limits While Preserving Scope)*  

## **1. Functional Language (35 U.S.C. § 112(f))**

Define elements by *what they do*, not measurements:  
- ❌ *“sub-wavelength features between 10nm and 400nm”*  
- ✅ *“sub-wavelength features configured to maintain phase coherence for a duration exceeding cryogenic decay rates”*  

## **2. Comparative Terminology**

Benchmark against known properties:  
- ❌ *“operates at temperatures above 77K”*  
- ✅ *“operates at temperatures exceeding conventional superconducting qubit thresholds”*  

## **3. Material-Centric Definitions**

Tie performance to intrinsic properties:  
- ❌ *“a laser emitting 780nm light”*  
- ✅ *“a coherent light source matched to the bandgap of the holographic medium”*  

## **4. Structural Relationships**

Describe interactions, not dimensions:  
- ❌ *“features spaced 10nm apart”*  
- ✅ *“features arranged to produce constructive interference at nodal points”*  

## **5. Negative Limitations**

Exclude workarounds without numbers:  
- ❌ *“requires less than 1μJ per operation”*  
- ✅ *“operates without cryogenic cooling”*

# **USPTO-Compliant Qualitative Claim Examples**

**1. Device Claim**  
*“A quantum memory device comprising:*  
*a holographic medium configured to store qubits as phase-stable interference patterns,*  
*wherein the medium exhibits topological protection against decoherence.”*  

**2. Method Claim**  
*“A method of quantum information processing comprising:*  
*encoding qubits via wave interference in a non-cryogenic medium,*  
*wherein the medium reconstructs quantum states from partial degradation.”*  

**3. System Claim**  
*“A quantum computing system comprising:*  
*a holographic medium exhibiting geometric redundancy,*  
*a phase-modulation system operatively coupled to the medium,*  
*wherein the system corrects errors via interference fringe reconstruction.”*

# **When To Use Numbers (If Absolutely Necessary)**

Reserve numerical limits for:  
1. **Critical novelty** (e.g., *“a room-temperature superconductor”*).  
2. **Prior art distinctions** (e.g., *“exceeding 50% efficiency where conventional systems achieve ≤30%”*).  

---

# **Prosecution Advantages**

1. **Avoids Design-Arounds**: Competitors can’t tweak a number to escape infringement.  
2. **Broader Interpretation**: Courts may construe qualitative terms more flexibly (e.g., *“cryogenic decay rates”* could cover future materials).  
3. **Simpler Amendments**: No need to argue precise numerical ranges during examination.

# **Potential Examiner Pushback & Responses**

- **“Indefinite under 35 U.S.C. § 112(b)”**  
  - *Response*: Cite technical standards (e.g., *“topological protection”* is well-defined in quantum physics literature).  
- **“Lack of enablement”**  
  - *Response*: Point to working examples in the specification (e.g., *“Example 3 demonstrates geometric redundancy”*).

# **Template For Qualitative Claims**

```  
1. A [device/system/method] comprising:  
   [Core component] configured to [functional capability],  
   wherein [qualitative performance metric].  

2. The [device/system/method] of claim 1, wherein:  
   [Component] exhibits [material property] enabling [behavior].  
```

*“The best claims are like quantum states—they exist in superposition until measured by litigation.”*  
—**Patent Prosecution Adage**  

*(Final Tip: Pair qualitative claims with detailed examples in the specification to satisfy enablement.)*
