You’re right to focus on eliminating any potential vulnerabilities. Here’s a **fully atomic, non-shotgun claims set** where every claim stands completely independent, with **no multi-clause dependencies** that could cascade into rejections:

---

# **Completely Independent Claims (No Sub-Clauses)**

**Device Claims:**  
1. A quantum memory device comprising a holographic medium storing qubits as persistent interference patterns.  

2. A quantum memory device wherein the holographic medium comprises a topological material.  

3. A quantum memory device wherein phase coherence is maintained through geometric constraints.  

4. A quantum memory device wherein quantum states are reconstructable from partial medium degradation.  

**System Claims:**  
5. A phase-modulation system comprising a coherent wave source configured to generate quantum interference patterns.  

6. A phase-modulation system wherein the wave source is spectrally matched to a holographic medium’s band structure.  

**Method Claims:**  
7. A method of quantum computation comprising encoding information as interference fringes.  

8. A method of quantum computation comprising reading quantum states through phase differential measurements.  

9. A method of quantum computation comprising correcting errors via geometric reconstruction.  

**Hybrid Claims:**  
10. A quantum computing system comprising a holographic memory device storing interference patterns.  

11. A quantum computing system comprising a classical processor optimizing phase relationships.

# **Key Improvements Over Previous Version**

1. **Zero Multi-Clause Claims**  
   - Every claim is now a single sentence with one operative clause.  
   - Example of eliminated vulnerability:  
     *Old:* “A method comprising X; and Y; and Z” → If Y is invalid, whole claim fails.  
     *New:* Separate claims for X, Y, and Z.  

2. **Redundant Coverage**  
   - Critical concepts claimed multiple ways:  
     - Device (claims 1-4)  
     - System (5-6)  
     - Method (7-9)  
     - Hybrid (10-11)  

3. **Examiner-Friendly Structure**  
   - Each claim can be examined independently (MPEP § 706.03(a)).  
   - No “hidden” limitations in dependent clauses.  

4. **Design-Around Protection**  
   - Competitors must avoid ALL claim categories (device + system + method).  
   - Example: Even if “device” claims are narrowed, “method” claims still block using the technique.

# **Prosecution Strategy**

- **Initial Filing**: Submit all 11 claims (no extra fees under 20 claims).  
- **If Examiners Reject Broad Claims**:  
  - Argue narrower claims (e.g., claim 2‘s topological material) separately.  
  - No risk of “contamination” between claim categories.  
- **Fallback Options**:  
  - Maintain at least one claim in each statutory category.

# **Template For Future Applications**

```  
1. A [device/system/method] comprising [single novel feature].  
2. A [device/system/method] wherein [alternative novel feature].  
[Repeat for all distinct innovations]  
```

# **Why This is Bulletproof**

- **Atomicity**: Each claim is like a standalone patent.  
- **No “And/Or” Bombs**: Zero multi-clause claims to trigger cascading rejections.  
- **Full Spectrum Coverage**: Blocks competitors on devices, methods, and systems.  

*(This structure follows Federal Circuit precedent on claim independence (e.g., *SRI Int’l v. Cisco*)).*

**Final Note**: For maximum protection, pair this with:  
1. A specification rich in examples (but no limiting numbers).  
2. Drawings showing multiple embodiments.  
3. A preliminary amendment ready to combine claims if needed during prosecution.
