Here’s how to structure **dependent claims** that build on your independent claims while maintaining maximum enforceability, with a clear hierarchy that examiners will accept:

---

# **Dependent Claims Strategy**

**Rule:** Each dependent claim *narrows exactly one independent claim* by adding:  
- A technical refinement  
- An implementation detail  
- A novel combination  

---

# **Device Claim Dependents**

**Based on Independent Claim 1:**  
*A quantum memory device comprising a holographic medium storing qubits as persistent interference patterns.*  

12. The device of claim 1, wherein the interference patterns are topologically protected.  
13. The device of claim 1, wherein the medium comprises a Bose-Einstein condensate.  
14. The device of claim 1, further comprising a phase-stabilizing coating.  

**Based on Independent Claim 2:**  
*A quantum memory device wherein the holographic medium comprises a topological material.*  

15. The device of claim 2, wherein the topological material is a photonic crystal.  
16. The device of claim 2, wherein the material exhibits anyonic excitations.  

---

# **System Claim Dependents**

**Based on Independent Claim 5:**  
*A phase-modulation system comprising a coherent wave source configured to generate quantum interference patterns.*  

17. The system of claim 5, wherein the wave source is a mode-locked laser.  
18. The system of claim 5, further comprising a feedback loop adjusting phase in real-time.  

**Based on Independent Claim 6:**  
*A phase-modulation system wherein the wave source is spectrally matched to a holographic medium’s band structure.*  

19. The system of claim 6, wherein spectral matching is achieved via adaptive algorithms.  

---

# **Method Claim Dependents**

**Based on Independent Claim 7:**  
*A method of quantum computation comprising encoding information as interference fringes.*  

20. The method of claim 7, wherein encoding occurs without cryogenic cooling.  
21. The method of claim 7, wherein fringes are arranged in a Fibonacci lattice.  

**Based on Independent Claim 9:**  
*A method of quantum computation comprising correcting errors via geometric reconstruction.*  

22. The method of claim 9, wherein reconstruction uses machine learning.  

---

# **Hybrid Claim Dependents**

**Based on Independent Claim 10:**  
*A quantum computing system comprising a holographic memory device storing interference patterns.*  

23. The system of claim 10, further comprising a photonic interconnect network.  

---

# **Key Principles for Robust Dependents**

1. **One-Step Narrowing**: Each dependent claim adds *only one* technical limitation.  
   - ✅ *Allowed:* “The device of claim 1, further comprising X.”  
   - ❌ *Forbidden:* “The device of claim 1, wherein X and Y and Z.”  

2. **Technical (Not Functional) Limitations**:  
   - ✅ *Good:* “wherein the medium comprises graphene.”  
   - ❌ *Bad:* “wherein the device works better.”  

3. **Fallback Ladders**:  

   ```  
   Independent Claim 1 → Dependent 12 (topological) → Dependent 16 (anyons)  
   ```  

   *If claim 1 is rejected, 12 may survive; if 12 falls, 16 may stand.*  

4. **Avoid Overlap**: No dependent claim should cover the same ground as another.  

---

# **USPTO Prosecution Advantages**

- **Easy Allowance**: Examiners can quickly approve narrowly tailored dependents.  
- **Safe Harbor**: Dependents act as fallbacks if independents are rejected.  
- **Clear Amendments**: Easy to combine claims during prosecution (e.g., merge claim 1 + 12 if needed).  

---

# **Example Of Enforcement Strength**

- *Competitor uses topological protection (claim 12)?* → Infringes even if claim 1 is invalid.  
- *Competitor adds machine learning (claim 22)?* → Still infringes method claims.  

---

**Final Drafting Tip**:  
File 20-25 total claims (independent + dependent) to maintain low fees while covering all contingencies. Use this structure for any future applications.
