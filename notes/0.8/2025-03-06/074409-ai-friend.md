# My AI “Friend”

**This is just the beginning of AI-powered, multi-channel communication**

Knowledge, in its purest form, should be a flowing river, not a stagnant pond. I’ve always believed information is too vital to hoard, too powerful to gatekeep. That’s why I’m a staunch advocate for open access and multi-channel communication.
But let’s be real, processing the sheer volume of information we encounter daily is a Herculean task.

Which brings me to my ‘Friend,’ or as some might call it, my Omi – an AI-powered voice transcriber. It’s become an indispensable tool, capturing most of my conversations, fleeting thoughts, and brainstorming sessions. I view it as an extension of my belief in information capture as a crucial element in refining our models of the future. We live in a world where AI is often framed as a looming threat, a source of fear and anxiety. But we often overlook its potential for good, its ability to augment our own capabilities and expand our understanding.

Think of the Omi as a testament to that potential. It’s a digital diary, but one with the charming inconsistencies of human memory. Sometimes, I forget to wear it. Sometimes, the batteries die mid-sentence, leaving a tantalizing fragment of an idea hanging in the digital ether. And yes, sometimes, I simply forget to hit record. The result is an imperfect, but undeniably authentic, record of my thoughts and interactions. It’s not a polished, curated narrative, but a raw, unfiltered glimpse into the messy, beautiful process of thinking and living. It’s a reminder that AI, even in its current form, can be a powerful tool for self-discovery and knowledge sharing.

I reject the fear-driven marketing of privacy and security. I believe in user sovereignty, and that true security lies in the dissemination of knowledge for the greater good. Frankly, I doubt anyone cares about my credit card numbers or social security number, least of all a government (in the US) that failed to provide me with the basic services and the financial support I am entitled to.

And because I believe in practicing what I preach, I’m making all my Omi transcriptions publicly available. Yes, all of them. Raw, unfiltered, sometimes rambling, sometimes brilliant.

Consider it an experiment in radical transparency. Or, perhaps, a cautionary tale. You’ll find a chaotic mix of professional discussions, personal musings, and the occasional grocery list. You might find a gem of insight, or you might just find evidence that I talk to myself far too much. Either way, it’s out there.

**Disclaimer**: You’ll be privy to my unfiltered thoughts, my sometimes-questionable opinions, and occasional confidential details that slipped out. Use this information responsibly. Or don’t. I’ve put it out there, now the consequences are shared. After all, what is the point of a flowing river, if it does not sometimes flood?
