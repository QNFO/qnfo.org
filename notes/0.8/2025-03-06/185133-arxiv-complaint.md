Hereâ€™s the revised formal complaint with the added language about federal funding and regulatory escalation, followed by an updated LinkedIn post:

**Subject:** Formal Complaint Regarding arXivâ€™s Endorsement Policy and Barriers to Open Scientific Discourse

**To:**
Cornell University Library
arXiv Administration
Email: arxiv-contact@cornell.edu

**CC:**
Office of the Provost, Cornell University
Email: provost@cornell.edu

**Dear arXiv Administration,**

[... Existing body of the complaint, unchanged until the conclusion ...]

# **Conclusion:**

arXiv has long been a cornerstone of open scientific exchange, but its current policies risk alienating a significant portion of the research community. **Given arXivâ€™s reliance on federal and grant funding, including support from agencies such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), I trust Cornell University will address these concerns promptly to ensure compliance with funding requirements.** Should this matter remain unresolved, I will escalate it to the relevant regulatory bodies, including the **NSF Office of Inspector General** and other oversight agencies.

I request a formal response outlining the steps arXiv will take to address these concerns. Please provide a timeline for review or reforms by [insert date within 30 days].

**Sincerely,**
Rowan Brad Quni
Principal Investigator, QNFO Institute

# **LinkedIn Post (Revised):**

ðŸ”¬ **Breaking Down Barriers in Science: A Call for Reform at arXiv** ðŸ”¬

As a researcher committed to **open science**, Iâ€™m disappointed by arXivâ€™s endorsement policy, which excludes independent voices and reinforces academic gatekeeping.

The requirement to secure endorsements from established users creates a **closed loop** that disadvantages researchers without institutional connections. This undermines arXivâ€™s mission to democratize knowledge.

Iâ€™ve formally urged @Cornell University to replace this system with transparent, equitable quality controls. **Given arXivâ€™s reliance on federal funding (e.g., NSF grants), Iâ€™ve also notified relevant oversight agencies of the need for compliance with anti-discrimination and open-access principles.**

Join me in advocating for:
âœ… Objective submission criteria
âœ… Support for independent researchers
âœ… Post-publication peer review

# **Key Additions Explained:**

1. **Federal Funding Reference:**
   - arXiv receives significant support from the **National Science Foundation (NSF)** and other federal agencies. By noting this, you emphasize Cornellâ€™s obligation to comply with funding requirements tied to equity and open access.

2. **Escalation to Regulatory Bodies:**
   - **NSF Office of Inspector General (OIG):** Responsible for investigating misuse of NSF funds or violations of grant terms.
   - **Other Agencies:** If arXiv receives funding from the Department of Energy (DOE) or NIH, their OIGs could also be notified.

3. **LinkedIn Post:**
   - Publicly highlights the connection between federal funding and accountability, signaling that systemic issues could have broader consequences.

This approach ensures your complaint underscores Cornellâ€™s accountability to its funders while maintaining a professional tone.
