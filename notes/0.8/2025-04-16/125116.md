Based on the sources, here are specific critiques of named entities that could be considered questionable:

*   The standard **decimal system** is critiqued for introducing limitations and potentially unphysical idealizations when used to describe the natural world.
*   The system of defining fundamental units by fixed physical constants (like **c**, **h**, **e**, **k\_B**) is criticized for creating a **self-referential system** that **risks insulating foundational physical theories from empirical challenge** and potentially **hindering fundamental discovery**. This system may also **exacerbate disciplinary silos**.
*   The **Standard Model of Particle Physics** is mentioned as relying on concepts whose fundamental nature remains a subject of profound inquiry.
*   The **ΛCDM model of cosmology** is criticized for relying on concepts whose fundamental nature remains a subject of profound inquiry. **George Ellis** has specifically critiqued **ΛCDM**, arguing that its reliance on unproven constructs like **dark matter** and **dark energy** undermines scientific integrity.
*   **Mordehai Milgrom’s Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) theory** is noted as being ignored by the mainstream, while **ΛCDM** adherents dismiss alternatives like **MOND** as “untestable”.
*   The **Big Bang theory**, deeply intertwined with **ΛCDM**, is critiqued for significant flaws. These include:
    *   **The Singularity Problem**: Assuming an infinitely dense initial state that contradicts quantum mechanics.
    *   **The Horizon Problem**: The uniformity of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) cannot be explained without invoking **inflation**, which is considered a highly speculative hypothesis.
    *   **The Flatness Problem**: The universe’s observed flatness requires fine-tuning, often addressed by invoking **inflation**.
    *   **Λ’s Role**: The cosmological constant's value is arbitrarily tuned.
*   The **Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations** are challenged as starting points for relativistic quantum mechanics due to numerous unphysical features beyond negative energy solutions, including predicting superluminal velocities for the Dirac electron, non-vanishing spontaneous acceleration for free particles, and non-orthogonality between positive and negative energy solutions.
*   The **Dirac Sea and Feynman-Stueckelberg interpretations** of antiparticles are questioned if free relativistic particles only possess positive energies, making the complex machinery to handle negative energies potentially unnecessary.
*   The concept of "**particles**" in relativistic quantum theories is challenged, with analyses suggesting that a consistent relativistic quantum theory cannot fundamentally support an ontology of strictly localizable particles, potentially making the language of particles (and antiparticles) a pragmatic description rather than fundamental entities.
*   The "Mathematical Trick" hypothesis posits that **antimatter** and **dark matter** might be sophisticated mathematical constructs rather than fundamental realities. While the report concludes antimatter is likely fundamental, the "Mathematical Trick" framing is considered considerably more plausible for **dark matter**.
*   The **particle interpretation** of quantum mechanics, particularly when combined with the **Copenhagen interpretation**, is criticized for relying on an external observer and the poorly defined process of **wave function collapse**. The definition of **measurement** in the **Copenhagen interpretation** is vague, the **role of the observer** is problematic, and **wave function collapse** is not explained.
*   The **collapse postulate** in quantum mechanics is criticized as appearing ad hoc, creating a dualistic dynamics, and having an ambiguous definition of "**measurement**".
*   Defining reality solely in terms of **information** is criticized for leading to a **tautology**, being **observer-dependent**, and having unclear **causal power**.
*   The tendency in theoretical physics to engage in "**Cult Of Mathematical Wishful Thinking**" is critiqued, where mathematical fixes (new fields, particles, symmetries, dimensions) are invented for problems and prematurely declared as likely real with minimal empirical justification, leading to a cycle of speculation and searching.
*   The **wavefunction (Ψ)** in quantum mechanics is subject to debate regarding its ontological status (whether it represents reality or knowledge).
*   The literal ontological interpretation of **superposition** in quantum mechanics is challenged by alternative interpretations.
*   The standard formulation of **wave function collapse** is questioned as a potential "trick" or placeholder.
*   The idea of **quantum information** as a fundamental substance ("It from Qubit") is considered speculative.
*   The common interpretation of **entanglement** implying "**spooky action at a distance**" (nonlocality) might be the "trick" if alternative explanations are viable.
*   The **Born rule** in quantum mechanics is empirically successful but lacks a universally accepted derivation or justification.
*   The **multiverse hypothesis**, often linked to **cosmic inflation**, is considered unscientific because other universes cannot be observed or tested.
*   **String theory** is criticized by **Lee Smolin** as “not even wrong” because it posits extra dimensions and a vast "landscape" of possible universes, making it untestable in any meaningful way.
*   The peer review and funding mechanisms of modern science are criticized for reinforcing conformity to prevailing paradigms and hindering radical ideas, such as those challenging **classical spacetime**.
*   The scientific establishment's preference for established theories like **classical spacetime** is argued to lead to resistance against new ideas, even when anomalies accumulate.
*   The naive **QFT calculation of quantum vacuum energy** is suggested to be flawed, potentially a mathematical artifact arising from the improper application of **QFT** at the interface with gravity.
*   The elementary **Standard Model Higgs** is viewed as potentially an effective description of deeper, possibly composite, dynamics due to the **Higgs hierarchy problem**.
*   The interpretation of **gauge symmetries** as fundamental versus descriptive redundancies or emergent phenomena remains open.
*   The initial perception of **Planck's quantization** as a "trick" might have influenced its early reception.
*   The initial observation-driven postulation of **dark matter**, lacking a concrete theoretical candidate, has guided decades of research.
*   **Einstein's** initial motivation for the **cosmological constant** for a static universe, though ultimately incorrect, has had a lasting impact on cosmology.
*   The **Copenhagen interpretation** is criticized for a vague definition of measurement, the role of the observer, and the unexplained wave function collapse.
*   The **Many-Worlds Interpretation** is criticized for being ontologically extravagant and having a debated probability interpretation.

These entities, along with the named individuals who have offered critiques, represent specific aspects of physics and cosmology that the sources suggest are subject to questioning and potentially based on flawed premises or interpretations.
