You're asking for named entities within the sources that present contradictions to other named entities. Here are some examples found in the provided texts:

- **Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM)** vs. **Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND)**:
    
    - ΛCDM requires dark matter halos to explain galaxy rotation curves. MOND, on the other hand, explains these curves as a built-in feature of its modified gravity.
    - ΛCDM successfully fits the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy spectrum. MOND, in its phenomenological non-relativistic form, fails to explain the CMB.
    - ΛCDM explains the Bullet Cluster separation naturally through the separation of dark matter and gas. MOND struggles to explain this phenomenon.
    - While ΛCDM provides the best overall fit to cosmological observations across all scales, it relies on the unknown dark matter and dark energy components. MOND excels at galaxy scales but has persistent failures at cluster and cosmological scales, such as the "residual mass" problem in galaxy clusters.
- **Standard Quantum Field Theory (QFT) with the Feynman-Stueckelberg interpretation of antiparticles** vs. **Alternative QFT formulations challenging negative energy solutions and particle ontology**:
    
    - Standard QFT interprets negative energy solutions of relativistic wave equations as antiparticles via the Feynman-Stueckelberg mechanism. Alternative viewpoints challenge the validity of the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations as starting points, citing unphysical features arising from negative energy solutions.
    - Standard QFT often relies on an ontology of particles and antiparticles. Some analyses and no-go theorems suggest a fundamental incompatibility between relativity and the concept of strictly localizable particles, pushing towards a purely field-centric ontology where "particles" are excitations. This contrasts with the particle-based interpretation inherent in the Feynman-Stueckelberg mechanism.
- **Classical Spacetime** vs. **The Holographic Principle**:
    
    - Classical spacetime, validated at macroscopic scales, breaks down at quantum levels, leading to issues like singularities and the unresolved unification with quantum field theory. The holographic principle offers a mathematically elegant alternative rooted in black hole thermodynamics and string theory, positing that information in a volume can be encoded on a lower-dimensional boundary.
    - The scientific establishment often grants leniency to classical spacetime due to its empirical validation within its domain, while demanding definitive proof from the holographic principle despite its potential explanatory power.
- **Inflationary Cosmology** vs. **Bouncing Cosmologies**, **String Gas Cosmology**, **Varying Speed of Light (VSL) Theories**, **Ekpyrotic and Cyclic Models**:
    
    - Inflationary cosmology proposes a period of rapid expansion in the early universe driven by an inflaton field to solve the horizon and flatness problems. Bouncing cosmologies propose a contraction followed by a bounce, avoiding an initial singularity. String gas cosmology suggests an early universe filled with hot strings. VSL theories posit a much larger speed of light in the early universe. Ekpyrotic and cyclic models involve colliding branes. These are all alternative scenarios aimed at resolving the Big Bang's initial condition problems that inflation also attempts to address.
    - Inflation's reliance on the unverified inflaton field and its primary success in explaining pre-existing problems (retrodictions) make it vulnerable to the charge of being a "mathematical trick". The existence of these alternatives underscores that inflation is not the only possible solution.
- **Standard Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics (e.g., Copenhagen)** with wave function collapse vs. **Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI)**, **Bohmian Mechanics**, **Objective Collapse Models (OCM)**, **Relational Quantum Mechanics (RQM)**, **QBism**, **Consistent Histories**:
    
    - The Copenhagen interpretation posits that measurement causes the wave function to collapse into a definite state. MWI denies wave function collapse, proposing all outcomes are realized in parallel universes. Bohmian mechanics describes particles with definite trajectories guided by a wave function, thus avoiding collapse. OCMs modify quantum dynamics to include physical collapse. RQM states that quantum states are observer-relative. QBism interprets quantum states as representing an observer's beliefs. Consistent Histories provides a framework for assigning probabilities to consistent sequences of events without collapse. These are all alternative interpretations that attempt to address the measurement problem and the nature of quantum reality in ways that differ fundamentally from the standard collapse postulate.
- **Particle Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics** vs. **Information-Theoretic Interpretations**:
    
    - The particle interpretation suggests that quantum entities are fundamentally particles that exhibit wave-like behavior. Information-theoretic interpretations posit that information is the most fundamental aspect of reality, with physical phenomena arising from it. John Archibald Wheeler's "it from bit" encapsulates this idea.
- **Realism** vs. **Instrumentalism/Anti-realism** in the philosophy of science regarding quantum mechanics:
    
    - Realism in the context of quantum mechanics seeks to understand the underlying physical reality described by the theory. Interpretations like MWI, Bohmian mechanics, and OCMs are realist as they offer specific ontologies. Instrumentalism (and anti-realism) views theories as tools for prediction, where the mathematical elements do not necessarily need to map directly onto reality. QBism aligns with this view. The "mathematical trick" hypothesis aligns well with instrumentalist stances.

These examples demonstrate contradictions between named entities within the sources, highlighting the ongoing debates and diverse perspectives in fundamental physics and cosmology.
