Okay, I understand your request. Here is an inline list of the entities you provided previously, with sentences outlining contradictions and falsifications based on the provided sources:

**General Relativity** strongly contradicts **Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND)**, **Tensor-Vector-Scalar gravity (TeVeS)**, **f(R) theories**, and **Emergent Gravity (EG)**, as these are alternative theories attempting to explain gravitational phenomena without dark matter by modifying gravity itself. **General Relativity** within the **ΛCDM** model requires **Dark Matter** and **Dark Energy**, so if evidence strongly indicated these do not exist or are not needed under a different framework, it would contradict the current standard application of **General Relativity** on cosmological scales. The **Steady-State Model** is contradicted by the expanding universe evidence that supports **General Relativity** as the framework for the **Big Bang theory**.

**Standard Model of Particle Physics** strongly contradicts theories that propose a continuum nature of reality without inherent quantization, as the **Standard Model** is built upon quantum principles. The need for explanations beyond the **Standard Model** for phenomena like neutrino masses, dark matter, and dark energy suggests potential contradictions or at least incompleteness if these phenomena cannot be accommodated within its existing framework. The **Mathematical Universe Hypothesis** offers a fundamentally different perspective on reality compared to the particle and field ontology of the **Standard Model**.

**Quantum Mechanics** strongly contradicts classical physics theories that do not incorporate quantization. Interpretations like **Bohmian Mechanics**, the **Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI)**, **Consistent Histories**, **Relational Quantum Mechanics (RQM)**, and **QBism** offer different ontological interpretations of **Quantum Mechanics**, thus contradicting the others' specific claims about the nature of quantum reality. **Objective Collapse Models (OCMs)** contradict standard **Quantum Mechanics** by proposing a physical mechanism for wavefunction collapse that goes beyond unitary evolution. **Classical Test Theory (CTT)** and **Item Response Theory (IRT)**, being rooted in classical statistics and measurement theory, operate on fundamentally different assumptions about the nature of measurement compared to **Quantum Mechanics**.

**ΛCDM** strongly contradicts models that explain cosmological observations without invoking **Dark Matter** and **Dark Energy**, such as **Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND)**, **Tensor-Vector-Scalar gravity (TeVeS)**, **f(R) theories**, and **Emergent Gravity (EG)**.

**Special Relativity**'s postulate of the universal constancy of $c$ is effectively removed from direct empirical test within the SI framework where $c$ is fixed by definition, changing how it is verified, but not directly contradicted by the act of definition itself. However, theories proposing a variable speed of light would contradict **Special Relativity**.

**Big Bang theory** is contradicted by the **Steady-State Model**, which posits a universe that expands but maintains a constant average density, and by models that avoid an initial singularity.

**Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**, as part of the **Standard Model**, shares the same potential contradictions with continuum theories mentioned above.

**Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND)** strongly contradicts **General Relativity** when applied to galactic and cosmological scales if **Dark Matter** does not exist. **MOND** also faces challenges explaining phenomena like the Bullet Cluster separation naturally, which is consistent with **ΛCDM** and **General Relativity** with dark matter.

**String Theory / M-Theory**'s requirement for **Extra Dimensions** is not directly contradicted by theories that do not require them, but the lack of empirical evidence for **Extra Dimensions** could be seen as a failure to support **String Theory** in its current form. **String Theory** aims to be a theory of everything, potentially encompassing and thus not contradicting the **Standard Model** at lower energies, but its high energy predictions and fundamental assumptions go beyond the **Standard Model**.

**Supersymmetry (SUSY)**, if not found at the LHC, faces increasing tension with experimental results, but is not strictly falsified as it could exist at higher energy scales. However, the lack of evidence for SUSY particles within the expected mass ranges for naturalness arguments could be seen as contradicting those specific motivations for SUSY.

**Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG)**, as an alternative approach to quantum gravity, contradicts the smooth spacetime assumed in **General Relativity** at the Planck scale, proposing a discrete, quantized structure of spacetime.

**Quantum Field Theory (QFT)**, being the framework for the **Standard Model** and QED, QCD, etc., faces the same potential contradictions with continuum theories. Some argue that **Quantum Field Theory** might be an effective description emerging from a more fundamental theory, implying a potential contradiction if a drastically different fundamental theory is confirmed.

**Cosmological Constant (Λ)** as a constant energy density causing accelerating expansion in **ΛCDM** is contradicted by dynamical dark energy models where the density changes with time, and by theories that explain cosmic acceleration through modifications of gravity.

**Inflation**'s specific models, such as **Chaotic inflation**, **Hilltop inflation**, **Natural inflation**, and **Higgs Inflation**, can contradict each other based on their specific predictions for the early universe, such as the tensor-to-scalar ratio of primordial fluctuations. **Inflation** as a general paradigm is challenged by alternative early universe scenarios that do not require a period of rapid expansion.

**Dark Matter** as a particle contradicts **Modified Gravity** theories like **MOND**, **TeVeS**, and **f(R) theories**, which attempt to explain galactic and cosmological observations without it. The persistent lack of non-gravitational detection of **Dark Matter** particles after extensive searches increasingly tensions the particle hypothesis.

**Dark Energy** as a separate component of the universe contradicts theories that explain cosmic acceleration through modifications of gravity or the **Cosmological Constant** being the sole driver of this acceleration if evidence strongly favors one over the others.

**Standard Model Extension (SME)** aims to incorporate Lorentz and CPT violation, so experiments finding definitive violations would support it, while continued null results in high-precision tests could constrain or contradict specific versions of the **SME** that predict effects within those experimental sensitivities.

**CPT theorem** would be falsified by any definitive experimental observation of CPT violation. The continued high-precision tests finding no violations currently support it against theories that predict such violations.

**Bell inequalities** are violated by quantum mechanics, and experiments confirming these violations falsify **Local Hidden Variable (LHV) theories** that assume both locality and realism.

**Kochen-Specker (KS) inequalities** are violated by quantum mechanics, and experiments confirming these violations rule out non-contextual hidden variable theories.

**Dirac's relativistic wave equation** initially seemed to have negative energy solutions, which appeared to contradict the idea of stable particles with positive energy, leading to interpretations like the **Dirac Sea**. However, the development of **Quantum Field Theory** and the **Feynman-Stueckelberg interpretation** provided a consistent framework resolving this by interpreting negative energy solutions as antiparticles.

**Yang-Mills theory** is a general framework for gauge theories, including parts of the **Standard Model**, so it's not directly contradicted by other theories unless they fundamentally reject the principle of gauge symmetry for fundamental interactions.

**Weinberg-Salam model** (Electroweak Theory) is a part of the **Standard Model**, so it shares similar potential contradictions.

**Electroweak Theory** would be contradicted by experimental results that deviate significantly from its predictions for the interactions of W and Z bosons and fermions.

**Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**, as the theory of strong interactions within the **Standard Model**, would be contradicted by experiments that show quark confinement is not absolute or that hadrons behave in ways inconsistent with the theory.

**Peccei-Quinn mechanism** and **Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism** are specific theoretical proposals attempting to solve the strong CP problem and explain fermion mass hierarchies respectively. If experimental evidence strongly disfavors the axion (predicted by the Peccei-Quinn mechanism) or the flavor structure does not align with the Froggatt-Nielsen model's predictions, these specific mechanisms could be contradicted.

**Mathematical Universe Hypothesis (MUH)** contradicts physicalist views where the universe is fundamentally made of matter and energy and governed by physical laws discovered through experiment, proposing instead that reality *is* mathematics.

**Emergent Gravity (EG)** strongly contradicts **General Relativity** by proposing that gravity is not a fundamental force but arises from a more fundamental underlying structure, often related to information or thermodynamics. **Verlinde's Emergent Gravity** is a specific formulation of this idea.

**f(R) theories** strongly contradict **General Relativity** by modifying the Einstein-Hilbert action, leading to different gravitational dynamics.

**Scalar-tensor theories** contradict **General Relativity** by introducing scalar fields that mediate gravity in addition to the tensor metric, leading to potential differences in gravitational phenomena.

**Brane World Scenarios/Models** (including **ADD Models** and **RS Models**) predict **Extra Dimensions**, so a definitive falsification of **Extra Dimensions** at the relevant energy scales would contradict these models. They also offer potential solutions to the hierarchy problem, so if other explanations are firmly established, the motivation for these specific scenarios might be weakened.

**TeVeS** (Tensor-Vector-Scalar gravity) is a relativistic version of **MOND** and thus contradicts **General Relativity** in regimes where **MOND** is successful without dark matter.

**FLRW model** (Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker) as the standard cosmological model describing a homogeneous and isotropic expanding universe is contradicted by observations that would definitively show large-scale anisotropies or inhomogeneities that violate its fundamental assumptions.

**Steady-State Model** is contradicted by the observational evidence for the **Big Bang theory**, including the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation and the abundance of light elements.

**WIMPs** (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) as a dark matter candidate are increasingly challenged by the lack of direct detection after many experiments. Strong evidence against other particle dark matter candidates could also indirectly put pressure on the WIMP hypothesis.

**QCD axion** as a dark matter candidate and solution to the strong CP problem would be contradicted by experiments that definitively rule out its existence within the relevant mass and coupling ranges.

**Sterile Neutrinos** as an explanation for neutrino anomalies face tension from conflicting experimental results, and strong null results from disappearance searches contradict appearance hints.

**Primordial Black Holes (PBHs)** as a dark matter candidate would be contradicted by observational constraints that rule out black holes in the relevant mass ranges making up a significant fraction of dark matter.

**Asymmetric DM** models, which propose a difference in the abundance of dark matter and anti-dark matter, would be contradicted if dark matter is found to be its own antiparticle and annihilating symmetrically.

**SIMPs** (Strongly Interacting Massive Particles) as a dark matter candidate are constrained by direct detection experiments and astrophysical observations that limit strong self-interactions.

**Fuzzy Dark Matter** models, based on ultralight axions, would be contradicted by observations that require denser, more compact dark matter halos than predicted by these models.

**Horndeski theories** are a broad class of scalar-tensor theories that generalize **General Relativity**. Specific sub-classes could be contradicted by observations that rule out the behavior predicted by their particular scalar field dynamics and coupling to gravity.

**Massive/bigravity theories** propose multiple gravitons. Observations that definitively rule out the existence or effects of additional gravitons beyond the massless one of **General Relativity** would contradict these theories.

**Einstein-Aether theories** propose a preferred frame of reference, violating Lorentz invariance at a fundamental level. Strong constraints on Lorentz violation from various experiments put pressure on these theories.

**DGP** (Dvali–Gabadadze–Porrati model) is a brane world model that modifies gravity at large scales. Cosmological and astrophysical observations that do not support its specific predictions for gravity at these scales would contradict it.

**Kaluza-Klein (KK) theory** predicts **Extra Dimensions** and a tower of massive particles. Lack of evidence for these predictions at accessible energy scales would challenge the theory.

**Calabi-Yaus** are complex geometric manifolds used in string theory for compactifying extra dimensions. While not directly contradicted, if string theory itself were falsified, the relevance of these specific mathematical structures to fundamental physics would be questioned.

**Base-60** and **Base-12** are numerical systems and do not directly contradict physical theories, but the argument in source suggests that reliance on **Base-10** might lead to inadequate descriptions of reality, implying a potential limitation or indirect contradiction in models heavily reliant on decimal approximations if a more fundamental description uses different bases.

**Non-Euclidean Geometry** is not contradicted by theories using Euclidean geometry where it is an appropriate approximation. However, theories proposing the fundamental geometry of spacetime is non-Euclidean (like **General Relativity**) would contradict any theory positing a fundamentally Euclidean spacetime at all scales.

**Category Theory** and **Information Theory** are mathematical frameworks. Their application to physics might offer alternative descriptions that could be seen as conceptually different from standard approaches based on differential geometry or a particle ontology, but they are not direct contradictions in most cases; rather, they represent different ways of framing physical principles.

**Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP)** as a dark matter candidate faces the same challenges as general WIMP candidates due to the lack of direct detection.

**General Linear Dilaton (GLD) model** is a specific cosmological model. Observations that deviate from its predictions for the expansion history and evolution of the universe would contradict it.

**Vector-Like Quarks (VLQs)** are predicted by some extensions of the **Standard Model**. Lack of their detection at the LHC within expected mass ranges puts pressure on these models.

**Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM)** extends the Higgs sector of the **Standard Model**. If the observed Higgs properties are definitively shown to be consistent with a single Higgs doublet, it would constrain or contradict simpler versions of the 2HDM.

**Flavor Changing Neutral Currents (FCNCs)** are suppressed in the **Standard Model**. Observations of FCNCs at rates significantly higher than predicted could point to new physics that contradicts the **Standard Model**'s flavor structure.

**Lepton Flavor Violation (LFV)** is highly suppressed in the **Standard Model** with massless neutrinos. Observations of LFV processes like μ → eγ at significant rates would be a clear sign of new physics contradicting the minimal **Standard Model**.

**Michelson-Morley type experiments** aimed to detect luminiferous aether and their null results strongly contradicted the existence of a stationary aether and paved the way for **Special Relativity**.

**Peccei-Quinn symmetry** is the symmetry associated with the **Peccei-Quinn mechanism**. If the axion (the Goldstone boson of this symmetry) is not found or if the strong CP problem is solved in a different way, the necessity of this specific symmetry would be questioned.

**Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitsky (DFSZ) model** and **Kim-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (KSVZ) model** are specific axion models. If axions are found with properties inconsistent with these models' predictions, they would be contradicted.

**See-saw models** (including **Type I Seesaw**) are popular mechanisms for generating neutrino masses by introducing heavy sterile neutrinos. If neutrino masses are found to arise through a different mechanism and heavy sterile neutrinos are ruled out, these models would be contradicted.

**Grand Unified Theories (GUTs)** aim to unify the fundamental forces at high energies. If proton decay (a common prediction of GUTs) is not observed at the predicted rates, or if the running of coupling constants does not converge as expected, these theories face challenges.

**Warped Extra Dimensions** models (like RS models) predict specific signatures at colliders related to the warped geometry. Lack of these signals constrains these models.

**String Theory Landscape** is the vast number of possible vacuum solutions in string theory. Critics argue that this lack of unique predictions makes it difficult to falsify or confirm string theory.

**Swampland program** in string theory identifies criteria that consistent low-energy effective field theories must satisfy to be embedded in string theory. Effective theories violating these criteria would be in the swampland, suggesting inconsistency with string theory.

**Feynman Diagrams** are a perturbative tool in **Quantum Field Theory**. Their validity relies on the assumptions of **QFT**, so if **QFT** is superseded, the fundamental basis of Feynman diagrams might be questioned, though they could still serve as effective calculational tools.

**Dirac Sea** interpretation of negative energy solutions in the Dirac equation is largely superseded by the **Feynman-Stueckelberg interpretation** within **QFT**, which is a more consistent and widely accepted framework.

**Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP)**, a cornerstone of **General Relativity**, would be contradicted by any experimental evidence showing that inertial mass and gravitational mass are not universally equal.

**Standard Model Lagrangian** is the mathematical formulation of the **Standard Model**. Theories proposing fundamentally different particles or interactions would require a different Lagrangian, contradicting the **Standard Model** Lagrangian.

**General Relativity Lagrangian** (Einstein-Hilbert action) is modified in alternative gravity theories like **f(R) theories** and scalar-tensor theories, thus these modifications represent contradictions.

**Bianchi identities** are mathematical constraints on the curvature tensor in Riemannian geometry, which underpin **General Relativity**. Theories that fundamentally alter the geometric description of spacetime might not respect these identities in the same way, representing a contradiction in their mathematical structure.

**CKM matrix (Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix)** describes quark mixing in the **Standard Model**. If experiments reveal quark flavor transitions that do not fit within the CKM framework
