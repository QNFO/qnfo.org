Continuing the list of named entities with factual contradictions based on the sources:

- The **Standard Model of Particle Physics** relies on concepts whose fundamental nature remains a subject of profound inquiry [Implied from a previous turn, based on source 0]. Specifically, the **Standard Model Higgs** is viewed as potentially an effective description due to the **Higgs hierarchy problem**, which requires extreme fine-tuning to keep the electroweak scale stable against large quantum corrections.
- The **ΛCDM model of cosmology** relies on concepts whose fundamental nature remains a subject of profound inquiry [Implied from a previous turn, based on source 0]. It faces the severe theoretical challenge of the **cosmological constant problem**, with a predicted vacuum energy density from Quantum Field Theory (QFT) being vastly (by 55 to 123 orders of magnitude) larger than the observed value, requiring extreme and unexplained fine-tuning. Additionally, it relies on **dark matter** and **dark energy**, for which there is a lack of direct detection for dark matter and the nature of dark energy (whether it's a constant Λ or a dynamical field) is uncertain. Tensions such as the **Hubble tension**, where different methods of measuring the Hubble constant yield inconsistent results, also pose a challenge.
- The **Big Bang theory**, deeply intertwined with **ΛCDM**, suffers from significant flaws. These include:
    - The **Singularity Problem**: Assuming an infinitely dense initial state that contradicts the principles of quantum mechanics.
    - The **Horizon Problem**: The uniformity of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) cannot be explained without invoking **inflation**, a highly speculative hypothesis.
    - The **Flatness Problem**: The universe’s observed flatness requires fine-tuning, often addressed by invoking **inflation**.
    - **Λ’s Role**: The cosmological constant's value is arbitrarily tuned to match observations.
- The **Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations**, proposed as starting points for relativistic quantum mechanics, possess numerous unphysical features beyond the negative energy solutions. These include predicting **superluminal velocities for the Dirac electron** and **non-orthogonality between positive and negative energy solutions**, leading to issues like negative probabilities in the Klein-Gordon case.
- The standard interpretation of **quantum mechanics**, particularly the **Copenhagen interpretation**, is criticized for relying on an external observer and the poorly defined process of **wave function collapse** [Implied from a previous turn, based on source 0, 67]. The definition of **measurement** in the **Copenhagen interpretation** is vague, the **role of the observer** is problematic, and **wave function collapse** is not explained [Implied from a previous turn, based on source 0, 67]. The **collapse postulate** appears ad hoc, creating a dualistic dynamics, and having an ambiguous definition of "**measurement**" [Implied from a previous turn, based on source 0]. Furthermore, the **wave function collapse** contradicts the unitary evolution of the wave function described by the Schrödinger equation.
- Defining reality solely in terms of **information** is criticized for leading to a **tautology** (information about what?), being **observer-dependent**, and having unclear **causal power** [Implied from a previous turn, based on source 0, 75].
- The naive **QFT calculation of quantum vacuum energy** results in an enormous discrepancy (by 55 to 123 orders of magnitude) compared to the observed cosmological constant, suggesting a fundamental conflict between QFT and General Relativity (GR) or a misinterpretation of the QFT calculation [Implied from a previous turn, based on source 0, 87, 94].
- While experiments currently show high precision in tests of **Lorentz invariance**, the possibility of its violation at a fundamental level remains an open question. Furthermore, the **CPT theorem** states that CPT symmetry must hold in any local, Lorentz-invariant QFT with a Hermitian Hamiltonian, so any observed CPT violation would imply Lorentz violation.
- The interpretation of **probability** in the **Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI)** of quantum mechanics is debated. Since all possible outcomes are realized in different branches, it is unclear what probability refers to and why observers should care about the amplitude squared of a branch.
- **Classical cosmology** fails to adequately describe the very early universe, particularly the Planck-era, as it cannot resolve the extreme informational contrasts at that scale. **Inflationary models** are invoked but rely on the unverified **inflaton field** and primarily offer retrodictive success.
- **Newtonian gravity** failed to accurately predict the **anomalous precession of Mercury's orbit**, a discrepancy that was later resolved by Einstein's General Relativity, which modeled spacetime curvature.
- The **WIMP miracle**, which posits that the thermal freeze-out of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) in the early universe would naturally produce the observed dark matter abundance, has not been supported by direct detection experiments after decades of searching. This creates a tension with one of the primary motivations for WIMP dark matter candidates.
- Naturalness arguments in Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics, such as the expectation of discovering low-mass supersymmetric particles at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to address the hierarchy problem, have largely not been borne out by experimental results. This creates a tension with the initial theoretical motivations and suggests that these models might require more fine-tuning than initially anticipated.
