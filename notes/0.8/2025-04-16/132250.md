Here are the entities and their direct contradictions, following the requested format:

Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM, Dark Matter and Dark Energy): Directly contradicts Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), f(R) theories, Emergent Gravity, the idea that its need for dark matter and dark energy is an artifact of the flawed SI measurement system, explanations based solely on visible baryonic mass, interpretations based on the idealized Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric, the assumption of a constant cosmological constant (Λ) when confronted with models with dynamic dark energy or modified gravity, perfect homogeneity and isotropy of the universe on relevant scales, and models that suggest dark matter might be a parameterization of our ignorance about gravity or astrophysical processes; Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM, Dark Matter and Dark Energy) is contradicted by the idea that its need for dark matter and dark energy is an artifact of the flawed SI measurement system, the lack of confirmed non-gravitational detection of dark matter, and tensions within the ΛCDM model.

Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND): Directly contradicts Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM, Dark Matter and Dark Energy) by explaining galaxy rotation curves without dark matter; Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is contradicted by Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM, Dark Matter and Dark Energy), the persistent failure to consistently explain phenomena across all scales, particularly in galaxy clusters and the early universe (CMB/LSS), the residual mass problem in galaxy clusters, and the Bullet Cluster separation.

f(R) theories: Directly contradicts Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM, Dark Matter and Dark Energy) by attempting to explain cosmic acceleration without dark energy by modifying gravity; f(R) theories are contradicted by Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM, Dark Matter and Dark Energy), the need for specific constructions and screening mechanisms, and being tightly constrained by data.

Emergent Gravity: Directly contradicts Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM, Dark Matter and Dark Energy) by proposing gravity arises from more fundamental degrees of freedom, potentially eliminating the need for dark matter and dark energy; Emergent Gravity is contradicted by Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM, Dark Matter and Dark Energy), being theoretically incomplete, and having no prediction yet for CMB/LSS.

Current scientific paradigm built on the SI system (with fixed constants): Directly contradicts a more fundamental description based on natural geometric constants like π and φ; Current scientific paradigm built on the SI system (with fixed constants) is contradicted by a more fundamental description based on natural geometric constants like π and φ.

Special Relativity's universal constancy of the speed of light (within the SI framework): Directly contradicts the fixed value of $c$ in the SI definition of the meter; Special Relativity's universal constancy of the speed of light (within the SI framework) is contradicted by the fixed value of $c$ in the SI definition of the meter.

Inherent quantization (as implied by fixed $h$): Directly contradicts alternative continuum-based models where discreteness emerges contextually; Inherent quantization (as implied by fixed $h$) is contradicted by alternative continuum-based models where discreteness emerges contextually.

Standard QFT with the Feynman-Stueckelberg interpretation of antiparticles: Directly contradicts alternative QFT formulations that challenge negative energy solutions and suggest antiparticles arise purely from symmetries; Standard QFT with the Feynman-Stueckelberg interpretation of antiparticles is contradicted by alternative QFT formulations that challenge negative energy solutions.

Alternative QFT formulations challenging negative energy solutions: Directly contradicts Standard QFT with the Feynman-Stueckelberg interpretation of antiparticles by proposing different foundations for relativistic quantum mechanics and the origin of antiparticles; Alternative QFT formulations challenging negative energy solutions are contradicted by Standard QFT with the Feynman-Stueckelberg interpretation of antiparticles due to the latter's established framework and predictive power regarding antimatter and CPT symmetry.

Standard logic: Directly contradicts paraconsistent logic in its ability to formally manage contradictions inherent in quantum superposition; Standard logic is contradicted by paraconsistent logic (in its ability to handle contradictions without triviality).

Paraconsistent logic: Directly contradicts standard logic by explicitly tolerating contradictions, proposed as better for handling superposition in quantum mechanics; Paraconsistent logic is contradicted by standard logic (in its fundamental principles regarding contradiction).

Euclidean geometry (as a universally applicable framework): Directly contradicts non-Euclidean geometries which are proposed as potentially more suitable for geometric interpretations of entanglement; Euclidean geometry (as a universally applicable framework) is contrasted with non-Euclidean geometries in terms of their applicability to certain physical phenomena.

Classical spacetime: Directly contradicts the holographic principle; Classical spacetime is contradicted by the holographic principle.

The holographic principle: Directly contradicts classical spacetime; The holographic principle is contrasted with classical spacetime.

Particle interpretation of quantum mechanics: Directly contradicts information-theoretic interpretations which posit that information is more fundamental than particles; Particle interpretation of quantum mechanics is contradicted by information-theoretic interpretations.

Information-theoretic interpretations of quantum mechanics: Directly contradicts the particle interpretation of quantum mechanics; Information-theoretic interpretations of quantum mechanics are contradicted by the particle interpretation of quantum mechanics.

Standard Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics (with wave function collapse): Directly contradicts Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI), Bohmian Mechanics, Objective Collapse Models (OCM); Standard Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics (with wave function collapse) is contradicted by Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI), Bohmian Mechanics, Objective Collapse Models (OCM).

Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI): Directly contradicts Standard Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics (with wave function collapse); Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) is contradicted by Standard Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics (with wave function collapse) (in its postulate of collapse), Objective Collapse Models (OCM) (which introduce collapse), Bohmian Mechanics (which posits definite particle trajectories).

Bohmian Mechanics: Directly contradicts Standard Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics (with wave function collapse); Bohmian Mechanics is contradicted by Standard Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics (with wave function collapse) (in its probabilistic collapse), Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) (which has branching universes).

The concept of a quantum-classical divide: Directly contradicts the view that there is a single, fluid reality where "classical" is just a low-resolution approximation of "quantum"; The concept of a quantum-classical divide is contradicted by the view of a single, fluid reality with quantum as the high-definition mode.
