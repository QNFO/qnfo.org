Infomatics is dead! Long live information (ontology)!

Progress necessitates a commitment to falsifying even one's own beliefs. Never let it be said I'm not willing to falsify mine... here's proof, a detailed succession of my failures: 

Also, #AI is superior for rapid prototyping and active falsification #failfast

Tl;dr: There's still something worth exploring further, which gives birth to Information Ontology (IO). It's interesting that the (AI-suggested) framework names have come full circle, starting a couple years ago with Quantum Information Ontology (QIO); which, for reasons that I have documented and critiqued extensively, now omits "quanta" on this next "strange loop" cycle around the information universe.

Okay, focusing on a more maximalist tone similar to "progress demands failure" while removing "I":
Here are a few options that amplify the sentiment:
Option 1 (Direct and forceful):
> The willingness to falsify beliefs is a non-negotiable condition for progress.
> 
Option 2 (Emphasizing necessity):
> Progress necessitates a commitment to falsifying even one's own beliefs.
> 
Option 3 (Connecting falsification directly to advancement):
> Advancement hinges on the readiness to falsify existing beliefs.
> 
Option 4 (Stronger emphasis on action):
> A dedication to falsifying beliefs is the engine of progress.
> 
Option 5 (Using a more abstract subject):
> The very nature of progress requires a willingness to falsify foundational beliefs.
> 
These options aim to convey a stronger sense of necessity and impact, aligning with the maximalist tone you're looking for.
