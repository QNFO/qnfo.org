EQR cannot be derived solely from abstract information bounds. It must incorporate the physics of the interaction process itself, specifically the **resonant nature** of stable manifestation over the interaction time 

You asked: "what substrate means if we've determined that information can't manifest without some physical form right?"

The IO v3.0 answer is: We haven't determined that. We've determined that information cannot manifest as observable phenomena (Î) without interaction (EQR).
