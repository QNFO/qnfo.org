# **Provisional Patent Application #1: Probabilistic Information Unit for Data Encoding and Error Correction**

## **Title:**

**Probabilistic Information Unit for Data Encoding and Error Correction**

## **Abstract:**

This invention discloses a novel method and system for encoding and processing information using probabilistic states in classical systems. The system utilizes stochastic probability distributions and error-correcting codes to achieve high-fidelity information processing without relying on quantum superposition or entanglement. The invention is particularly useful for applications in data storage, communication, and machine learning.

## **Background:**

Existing “quantum” patents often misapply the term to classical systems that use probabilistic methods but lack quantum mechanical foundations. For example, patents like **US-2022362450-A1** (Thoughtspot, Inc.) label data-sharing methods as “quantum” but rely on classical probabilistic protocols. Similarly, **US-10263967-B2** (Quantum Interface LLC) claims “quantum” identifiers but uses classical hashing algorithms. This invention clarifies the distinction between quantum and classical probabilistic systems.

## **Summary Of the Invention:**

The invention comprises:
1. **Data Encoding Module**: A classical processor configured to encode data into probabilistic states using stochastic probability distributions.
2. **Memory Unit**: A memory array storing probabilistic information units, each unit encoded with redundancy for error correction.
3. **Controller**: A controller executing Monte Carlo sampling to validate results without relying on quantum superposition or entanglement.

## **Detailed Description:**

### **1. Data Encoding Module:**

- **Stochastic Probability Distributions**: The system generates a stochastic probability distribution for input data, allowing for probabilistic encoding.
- **Parallelized Matrix Operations**: The system applies parallelized matrix operations to encode the data into probabilistic states.

### **2. Memory Unit:**

- **Redundancy Encoding**: Each probabilistic information unit is encoded with redundancy to enable classical error correction.
- **Error-Correcting Codes**: The system uses classical error-correcting codes (e.g., Reed-Solomon, LDPC) to detect and correct errors.

### **3. Controller:**

- **Monte Carlo Sampling**: The controller validates the encoded data via Monte Carlo sampling, ensuring high-fidelity results.
- **Bayesian Inference**: The system uses Bayesian inference to refine probabilistic estimates and improve accuracy.

## **Claims:**

**Claim 1:**

1. Generating a stochastic probability distribution for input data;
2. Applying parallelized matrix operations to encode the data into probabilistic states;
3. Validating the encoded data via Bayesian inference without quantum hardware.

**Claim 3:**
A probabilistic information unit system that does not require:
- Superconducting circuits (e.g., **US-10361353-B2**, Intel);
- Photon entanglement (e.g., **JP-7254234-B2**, Cambridge Quantum Computing);
- Topological qubits (e.g., **US-10346348-B2**, Microsoft).

The invention is particularly useful for applications in logistics, finance, and machine learning.

## **Background:**

Many existing patents labeled as “quantum” overreach by claiming quantum-inspired algorithms that can be implemented using classical hardware. For example, **US-11316065-B2** (Artilux, Inc.) claims “quantum computing” but relies on classical lithography and materials (e.g., silicon). Similarly, **US-10686007-B2** (Intel) uses “quantum dot devices” but lacks quantum hardware. This invention positions classical quantum-inspired algorithms as a practical alternative to true quantum systems.
