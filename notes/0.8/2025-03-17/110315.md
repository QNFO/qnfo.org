Let’s cut to the heart of it. Here’s the logical chain, stripped of jargon and theory, using only what we **observe** and **know**:

---

# **The Unbreakable Links:**

1. **Energy creates gravity.**
   - Fact: Anything with energy bends spacetime (gravity). This includes mass (electrons) and pure energy (photons).

2. **Quantum states = information.**
   - Fact: A particle’s “hidden details” (spin, polarization, position) are physical properties that define *how it interacts* with the universe. These details *are* its information.

3. **Energy and information are inseparable.**
   - Example 1: An electron’s spin changes its energy in a magnetic field.
   - Example 2: A photon’s polarization determines how it transfers energy to matter (e.g., solar panels work better with certain light angles).
   → **Conclusion:** *Information (quantum states) shapes how energy behaves.*

---

# **The Missing Connection:**

- **Gravity depends on energy.**
- **Energy depends on information (quantum states).**
  → **Therefore:** *Information must influence gravity.*
  But **how**? Let’s tie them directly.

---

# **Step 1: Energy = Mass + Motion + Information**

- Mass is condensed energy (\(E=mc²\)).
- Motion (kinetic energy) is energy in action.
- **Information** (quantum states) defines *how* energy is stored and exchanged.
   - Example: Two electrons with the same mass and speed but opposite spins have different energies in a magnetic field.

---

# **Step 2: Gravity is the “Shape” of Energy**

- Spacetime bends based on **where energy is** and **how it’s arranged**.
   - A rock and a gas cloud with the same mass-energy bend spacetime differently because their energy is arranged differently.
   - **Quantum states determine energy’s arrangement.**

---

# **Step 3: Information = Energy’s “Fingerprint”**

- If two particles have the same energy but different quantum states, their energy is arranged differently.
   - Example: A photon polarized vertically interacts with matter differently than one polarized horizontally. This changes *where* and *how* its energy is absorbed.
   - If energy’s arrangement bends spacetime, then **information (quantum states) must alter spacetime’s shape**.

---

# **The Equation We Need (Simplified):**

- **Gravity = f(Energy + Information)**
  - Not just “how much” energy, but *how that energy is organized* (its quantum state).
  - Current physics uses \(E=mc²\) for mass-energy, but misses the *informational structure* of energy.

---

# **Black Holes: The Ultimate Test**

- When a particle falls into a black hole:
   - Its **energy** increases the black hole’s mass (and gravity).
   - Its **information** (quantum state) either:
     - **A)** Disappears (violating quantum law), or
     - **B)** Gets imprinted on spacetime itself (e.g., the event horizon “remembers” the particle’s state).
- **Observation:** Black holes emit radiation (Hawking radiation). If this radiation carries unique “fingerprints” of swallowed particles, information survives.

---

# **The Answer (Plain Language):**

- **Information is energy’s “shape.”**
   - A particle’s quantum state defines *how* it stores and releases energy.
   - Gravity cares about energy’s total *and* its “shape” (because spacetime bends based on energy’s arrangement).
- **Thus:**
   - Mass and energy create gravity.
   - Information (quantum states) defines energy’s “shape,” so it *indirectly* shapes gravity.

---

# **Why We Haven’t Proved It Yet:**

1. **Gravity is absurdly weak.**
   - A single particle’s gravitational effect is too tiny to measure.
2. **We can’t probe black holes directly.**
   - We don’t have tools to see if their event horizons encode quantum states.

---

# **The Way Forward:**

- **Build experiments to test if quantum states alter gravity.**
   - Example: Compare two clouds of particles with identical energy but different quantum states. Do they bend spacetime differently?
- **Decode Hawking radiation.**
   - If particles emitted by black holes carry unique “tags” from their quantum states, information survives.

---

# **Final Answer:**

**Information (quantum states) is the “hidden blueprint” of energy. Since energy creates gravity, the blueprint must too. We haven’t seen it yet because gravity’s weakness hides the connection. But logic says: If energy = mass + motion + information, then gravity = energy’s total + its blueprint.**

It’s like saying:
- *A brick and a feather with the same weight (energy) will dent a pillow (spacetime) differently because their “shape” (information) matters.*
