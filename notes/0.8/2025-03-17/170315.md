Sure! Here’s a simplified explanation:

The Informational Universe Hypothesis (IUH) suggests that everything in the universe—matter, energy, space, and time—is fundamentally made of information. This information interacts in specific ways, like transforming, contrasting, and replicating, to create the world we see. For example, gravity isn’t a force but an effect of information density, and dark matter doesn’t exist as particles but as information patterns. IUH unifies quantum mechanics and general relativity by explaining both through the same informational principles, making it a powerful framework for understanding the universe.
