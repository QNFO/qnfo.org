Final and Severable Claims for the Patent Application**

These claims are structured to ensure **severability**, **independence**, and **compliance with USPTO requirements**. Each claim contains only one statement or clause, and they are organized to cover the core principles and dependent features of the invention. If any part of any claim is invalidated, it does not affect the validity of the core invention or other related claims.
