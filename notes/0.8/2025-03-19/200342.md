All right so we’re finding the four information fundamentals realizing that state change and contrast are related and that state change doesn’t count for sequence or progression or interval or repetition or order that we considered time so that’s that’s not going to be its own fundamental because State change doesn’t get added State change while like it says State change and so if it doesn’t change then that suggests it’s not really a fundamental I’m having a little trouble with this but it seems like what I actually what’s actually meant is that contrast derives from State change you can’t have contrast if you don’t have a state change okay so then that’s how we determine that just like mimicry derives from repetition okay so now we’ve got these branches mimicry derives from repetition and contrast rise from State change okay and the order now the the sequence the progression or what we call time matters so you can’t have caused and effect without a time or in order okay and so cause and effect now derives from derive some water so now we’ve actually got these wet down to down to two in a way right? and the way we’re slicing it in terms of how we consider say consciousness now contrast is now that comparison okay so you can have a state change but then you know how do we collapse that into saying oh the you know the dimmer when the dimmer is below this value will consider that off like a legit model versus a probate dimmers below the civil consider that off or above this value then that represents contrast you know think about a gray scale you know how do you determine what two values contrast with each other right well one is it’s the level of precision of the state change you know how how closely a monitor can depict values IE you know is it a 256 in a spectrum or is it you know 32 million so that determines your sort of measurement device just like we can’t we can’t measure a plank constant so we’re you know and so determining contrast then and a Quantum level becomes impossible because we can theorize it but we can’t measure that so we don’t actually know what’s happening so then any model is now already in in aggregate model cuz we can’t measure the the progression of the universe which are plank which is thought to be plank intervals
