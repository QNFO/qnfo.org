the cognitive Revolution means that our minds now create the hologram of reality we imagine ourselves walking through a doorway or following a windy road or climbing a mountain but these are not what they seem. 

Consider the following love visiting Bangkok recently I went to the roof of one of the highest buildings which has a glass observation deck cantilever over what seems to be a precipitous drop below. In fact it is a carefully calculated illusion of engineering where several layers of reinforced and break resistant glass like a car windshield are designed to maximize The view and give the impression as though one could fall right through. But indeed even cracking the glass would not shatter it it is all an illusion of our minds and our incomplete information about how such things work. With that in mind I would submit that a small baby or even an animal that is not familiar with these constructs perhaps would not be afraid as I saw several people were screaming once they had gotten out there and realized that the illusion appears that they were many hundreds of feet suspended over an abyss
