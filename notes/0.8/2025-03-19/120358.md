Informational dynamics (i.e. the informational universe) exists independent of time, which is a an emergent physical property. This, Einstein was on the right track: all of the information about ‘the future” and its sequence of dependencies (synchronicity, attractors, etc) that form a chain of entropy already exists. So we can already see the future! ...by looking at the sequence and attractor state (entropy) of information that is known, not in a spacetime “block” as he (incompletely) imagined it.
