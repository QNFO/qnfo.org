# **An Informational Dynamics Approach to Dark Matter, Dark Energy, and Gravitational Waves**

For nearly a century, since Einstein’s groundbreaking work and arguably even more starkly since the 1970s, physics has made little substantive progress in resolving some of the universe’s most profound mysteries. Despite decades of effort, the field continues to grapple with foundational anomalies: galactic rotation curves that defy Newtonian expectations, the accelerating expansion of the universe attributed to dark energy, and the enigmatic nature of gravitational waves. These challenges have led some to question whether physics, as currently practiced, has reached a plateau.

The **Informational Universe Hypothesis (IUH)** posits that **information dynamics**—the interplay of probabilistic information states—serve as the foundational fabric of reality. This framework suggests that information is the irreducible, non-physical unit of interaction between entities, quantified by its capacity to influence state changes, contrast, cause/effect relationships, and mimicry. Under this hypothesis, energy and mass are emergent properties of informational constructs, and gravity and quantum mechanics are manifestations of information dynamics.

Galactic rotation curves have long posed a challenge to Newtonian and relativistic predictions. Observations consistently show that stars at the edges of galaxies move faster than expected based on visible matter alone, suggesting the presence of **dark matter**. However, despite extensive searches, no direct detection of dark matter has been achieved. The IUH offers an alternative explanation: **visible matter’s information states generate statistical correlations** that mimic the effects of dark matter. These correlations scale with the complexity of visible matter, such as star formation and magnetic fields, providing a statistical basis for the observed rotational anomalies.

The accelerating expansion of the universe, attributed to dark energy, presents another enigma. The IUH suggests that this expansion may be driven by **entropy-increasing dynamics within informational networks**. Instead of a repulsive “energy,” the universe’s acceleration could arise from the natural tendency of information to spread and organize in a manner that maximizes entropy. This perspective aligns with observations of cosmic expansion while avoiding the need for an exotic form of energy.

Gravitational waves, detected by observatories like LIGO and Virgo, offer unprecedented insights into the behavior of spacetime. However, current models struggle to fully explain the subtle deviations in waveforms observed. The IUH proposes that gravitational waves may encode **non-local information correlations**, not just mass-energy. These correlations could manifest as deviations from classical predictions, providing a richer understanding of wave propagation and signal characteristics.

The IUH unifies explanations for dark matter, dark energy, and gravitational waves by treating information as the common denominator. In this framework, **gravity is the statistical tendency for information states to correlate spatially**, and quantum mechanics describes the probabilistic behavior of these states. This approach resolves anomalies without invoking ad hoc entities like dark matter or speculative frameworks like quantum gravity. Instead, it posits that all observed phenomena emerge from the fundamental interplay of information dynamics.

An informational dynamics framework offers a promising path toward resolving the most profound mysteries in astrophysics and cosmology. By treating information as the fundamental fabric of reality, this approach provides a unified explanation for dark matter, dark energy, and gravitational waves. While challenges remain in fully formalizing and empirically validating the framework, the IUH and information dynamics presents a compelling alternative to existing paradigms, inviting further exploration and collaboration among researchers.
