Multi-channel in multi-channel out means it’s not to do a specific form factor so maybe no one device gives me visuals and another gives me sort of magnetic or somehow affects gravity or a brain waves or any kinds of energy which are function of information can be yeah and so that’s that’s what you should describe energy whatever that is where is input is consistent with information on Dynamics which which could be energy it could be physical States but then ultimately what we’re trying to do is predict that that middle layer that that intermediate layer which is the informational layer and then figure out what to do with that so also another novel idea is that we’re not trying to pre program discreet event so let’s take email as an example rather than this idea of getting a device hooked up just like saving passwords it takes that especially with multi-channel communication to a different level so now it sees me login my email or maybe even download an app and so they can learn my patterns and then it’ll figure out what that means and and so then I can start you know with training wheels on getting comfortable and that’s you know that’s that’s part of it too there’s there’s a learning process and a reinforcement that that provides a feedback loop just like language AI the model for this is language I which is great it’ll learn and can be fine-tuned etc maybe there’s a just like dictation maybe there’s a training you know so we have to calibrate it so calibration is part of it I also the other really intriguing thing as we’re thinking broadly about inputs and outputs informationally is this idea of an information signature and so now that actually means that the data especially start talking about a web of data that is facilitated by something like blockchain is out there and as a contrast to this this surveillance paradigm and the the onus on me to request to opt out of data frameworks data collection now I’ve got a signature so every time I’m going somewhere that signature is being collected and and at delivered to speed intervals I can say forget me you know erase that signature so everyone should have the right to start over as opposed to the right to be forgotten it’s not the right to be forgotten because it has that has to be an active process we can’t just say you know forget me forever well if I continue existing but you know in theory perhaps somebody’s you know final wishes could be the moment of death I wish to be forgotten you see what I’m saying but it’s this informational signature that we all have that means I don’t need to carry advice to get data about me you know think about how many different data points are collected by say surveillance cameras or you know or GPS that does require something of device or you know image recognition I’m captured on surveillance cameras or maybe I go into a shop talk to a shop owner you know so now I don’t even need the device it it becomes more about like managing the inputs and outputs but it can start to stop establish a paradigm where information really is free flowing it the information doesn’t require a specific device or a dedicated device that’s the pebble platform that’s the promise is the devices there’s no device you know the OS is there is none unless you want it you know obviously people are going to like it some people are going to want to stay on you know typewriters who knows but the point is that IT addresses the few key things one user sovereignty because now I’m connected to all of my data not just the data I know about so this takes data brokers out of the equation you know with a blockchain distributed Network we’re all our own data brokers and maybe I want to sell it or give it away for research or you know do some analysis myself I’m The sovereign of my information signature which can then be enforced through that and then also in terms of processing we’re clearly talking about about Quantum probabilistic information States and that’s going to be fun because that suggests you know a Quantum process and information processor and so the other part of that is now now we’re tying into State change so it’s recording these events it doesn’t have to label them it’s unsupervised learning it’s recording these the state changes and contrast differences between States you know second ago I was here with this gravity level we’re brainwave activity and then now I’m you know somewhere else I’m in different part of the world or I’m sitting somewhere else or I’m I’m sitting Brothers standing or can I breathing is slow down any of these things are changes and information States I need the sequence of what we call time and now these contrast can be used to determine intent cause and effect what do I it can learn it will learn what I’m intending to do just by passively observing it’s just passive I don’t have to say you know oh Lord check my email this is a passive process now they can take many fours then the real cherry on top is what we’re trying for is mimicry which is the state of intelligence systems to understand the other four fundamentals and mimic it you know I can if I don’t understand the intent or pleasant fact of say language it’s going to be hard for me to communicate but I understand these things then I can pick up on them and so now this web of sensors starts to be really powerful tools for essentially moving beyond language now these processes are much more fluid they don’t require discreet sort of events that are imperfect at that like figuring out what words mean it becomes more fluid so it doesn’t matter you might like reading or communicating in your language just like records that’s fine but now there’s a much more fluid process that that helps me navigate and then also you know the end result for me to know myself better and also for me to interact with with others you know this personal human device except it’s not really a device it’s a system it’s a web and it might take the forms of certain input or output devices but that also isn’t really the point of the Internet of things The Internet of things really isn’t about the things at all they’re just data capture it’s it’s what it represents
 it's it's what it represents
