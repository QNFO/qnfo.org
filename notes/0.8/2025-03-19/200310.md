Now you got an interesting conflict result because what we seem to be saying now is that sequence is a dependency for cause and effect and mimicry is has that as a dependency to maybe a weaker one there’s something you sort of weak and strong dependencies now so we’ve all got this into related web that we can draw some morphology these different dependencies so here’s an example for State change you need variation okay some kind of variation how we measure that say binary versus quantum or discrete versus continuous that’s another sort of dependency that can weave into this with these with these specs so now okay so now we’ve got c*** we’ve got pairs which itself is a contrast so you’ve got static versus dynamic so if something is static then there’s nothing dependent on that but if something that was dynamic then that branch is out into other areas so maybe that’s what we need to do rather than think about these as mutually exclusive categories which is construct them morphology with it or graph directed graph Network where things are dependent on each other and I’d be interested to see whether any of those any of those edges loopback on themselves and create some kind of like dependency loop on themselves which would seem to be some kind of paradox and suggest that that we can talk about these primitives but in fact there are no fundamentals there’s just a sort of interconnected web of some kind of primitives and then we could get as complex on that as we want
