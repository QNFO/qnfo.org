So here’s an interesting refinement to the whole primitives and fundamentals and derivatives model so we can draw we can try to draw a directed graph Network at least I think it’s directive be directed because you know take the the opposites the set the gradient that goes from static to dynamic however defining maximal dynamic maybe some kind of entropy so maybe that’s an entropy entropy is one primitive then because without entropy you don’t have state change in a way but that’s not the whole story then because there are other things that kind of feed into that graph Network depending on how you think about it so time is not entropy per se but it’s now a sequence so then you’ve got now interview related to sequence and then order is also related to sequence but as is repetition but repetition doesn’t have a cause and effect who doesn’t have a directed orders so now we’ve got that now we’ve got directed and undirected feeding into this as well so you see how these they’re different I don’t know well nodes and edges where we’re creating a self-similar model that is using itself to model itself when we’re talking about these primitives so that’s really what that is just the self similar model
