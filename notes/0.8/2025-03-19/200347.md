I like talking about dependencies to figure out what’s most fundamental so morphologies and some kind of directed graph can help us roll back and see okay what’s that depending on all right well then it’s not the least common denominator it’s not the most fundamental unit all right let’s roll that back so how far back can we go though so that’s that’s a helpful way of okay and that itself then implies in order there’s a sequence and so State change is then implicit in order because something’s changing or otherwise there wouldn’t be a sequence or a state change so then everything then depends perhaps on border progression cuz you can’t I don’t see how you can have contrast without without a sequence and then State change now so it starts to look a lot more like contrast and then repetition again how can you repeat something or how can you have intervals without order so it all goes back to order as being the sort of fundamental thing so time now all of a sudden becomes really important even though we don’t know what we’re talking about when we say... Maybe we should just call this instead of the time paradox it’s the time Dynamics so maybe by informational what we’re actually talking about is this idea of a sequencer or progression what is information then and how does it relate to time because if we’re if we’re trying to clean the time is a primitive fundamental okay well what does that mean it’s a sequence of States it’s a sequence of change okay and now we can Branch off of that and say it deliberate mimicry and and repetition I’m starting to lose my own train of thought here but let’s see what we can do with it
