A brief overview of information Dynamics. The latest framework started from the Informational Universe hypothesis (IUH), formalized by what I called the four fundamentals of universal information, which then morphed as I realized that some of those were reducible to more foundational components. I’m largely happy with the structure outlined below but considering whether the math formalisms developed so far would be better expressed as primitive informational axes in a manifold, which would make sense considering this seeks to pick up where Einstein’s field equations leave off.
