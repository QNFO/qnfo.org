# **Key Style Guidelines**

## **General Tips**

1. **Conciseness**:**  
   - *Nature/Science*: 4,000–5,000 words (main text).  
   - *PRL*: 4,000 words max, with strict focus on core results.  

2. **Tone**:  
   - Avoid speculative language; frame κ as a **hypothesis-driven framework** with empirical support.  
   - Use active voice (e.g., “We propose κ as a metric…”).  

3. **Headings**:  
   - **Nature/Science**: Use minimal subsections (e.g., Introduction, Results, Discussion, Methods).  
   - **PRL**: Use standard headings (Introduction, Theory, Results, Discussion).  

4. **Avoid Philosophical Framing**:  
   - Focus on **empirical and theoretical validation** (e.g., κ’s role in DFS, quantum erasure experiments).  
   - Mention “symbolic relationships” but tie them to measurable outcomes (e.g., κ decay rates).
