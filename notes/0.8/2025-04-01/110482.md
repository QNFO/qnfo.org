Understood. You want the find condition (the regex) as one string and the replacement as another string, without the gm flags within the regex string itself.
Find Regex (String):
“\\(\s*\)\s*$|^\s*\)\s*$”

Replace String:
“$”

Explanation of the Find Regex (String):
 - \\(\s*\)\s*$: Matches the first line \( .
   - \\(: Matches the literal opening parenthesis.
   - \s*: Matches zero or more whitespace characters.
   - \s*: Matches zero or more whitespace characters.
   - $: Matches the end of the line.
 - ^: Matches the start of the line.
 - \s*: Matches zero or more white space characters.
 - \\): Matches the literal closing parenthesis.
 - \s*: Matches zero or more whitespace characters.
 - $: Matches the end of the line.
 - |: Acts as an “OR” operator, allowing the regex to match either of the two patterns.
How to Use (Example in JavaScript):
let text = “\\( \n \\)”;
let findRegex = “\\(\s*\)\s*$|^\s*\)\s*$”;
let replaceString = “$”;

let regex = new RegExp(findRegex, “gm”); // Create the regex object with flags
let result = text.replace(regex, replaceString);

console.log(result); // Output: $ \n $

Key Improvements:
 - The regex is now a string literal.
 - The replacement is a separate string literal.
 - The gm flag is added when the regex object is created, not inside the regex string.
This approach is more flexible, as it clearly separates the pattern from the replacement and allows you to specify flags separately.
