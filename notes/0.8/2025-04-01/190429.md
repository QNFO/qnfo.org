Here’s the **full list of equations** from the document with **sequential numbering**, followed by a **regenerated excerpt of key sections** using these equations. This ensures consistency across all sections of the paper.

---

# **Equations**

1. **Single-Dimensional Contrast**:  

   $$
   \kappa^{(d)}(i_a, i_b) = \frac{|i_a^{(d)} - i_b^{(d)}|}{\epsilon^{(d)}} \quad (1)

$$

2. **Total Contrast (Non-Euclidean)**:  
   $$

   \kappa(i_a, i_b) = \sqrt{\sum_{d=1}^{k} \left( \kappa^{(d)} \right)^2} \quad (2)

$$  

3. **κ Decay Rate**:  
   $$

   \frac{d\kappa}{dt} \propto -\Gamma \epsilon_{\text{effective}} \quad (3)

$$

### **Regenerated Sections with Equation Numbering**

---

#### **Section 3.2: Mathematical Formalism of κ**
For any two states \(i_a\) and \(i_b\) in a dimension \(d\), κ is defined as:  
$$

\kappa^{(d)}(i_a, i_b) = \frac{|i_a^{(d)} - i_b^{(d)}|}{\epsilon^{(d)}} \quad (1)

$$  
The **total contrast** across all dimensions \(k\) is then:  
$$

\kappa(i_a, i_b) = \sqrt{\sum_{d=1}^{k} \left( \kappa^{(d)} \right)^2} \quad (2)

$$  
This formalism ensures κ is both resolution-dependent and continuous, applicable even in systems influenced by environmental noise or spacetime curvature.  

---

#### **Section 3.8: Κ Decay and Engineering Solutions**
The rate of κ decay is governed by environmental noise and mimicry (m):  
$$

\frac{d\kappa}{dt} \propto -\Gamma \epsilon_{\text{effective}} \quad (3)

$$  
where Γ is noise strength. By dynamically tracking κ and applying feedback (e.g., targeted cooling), systems can restore fine ε before superposition is lost.  

---

#### **Section 4.1: Decoherence as Κ Decay**
Decoherence—the loss of quantum coherence—is reinterpreted as κ degradation governed by Equation (3):  
$$

\frac{d\kappa}{dt} \propto -\Gamma \epsilon_{\text{effective}}

$$  
Superconductors in cryogenic dilution refrigerators maintain κ ≈ 1 due to mimicry (m ≈ 1), while exposed qubits decay to κ ≈ 0.5 within microseconds.  

---

#### **Section 4.5: Implications for Quantum Computing**
κ-aware protocols leverage Equation (3) to track decay rates and apply interventions. For example, if a qubit’s κ drops below 0.9, Equation (1) and (2) ensure that resetting ε to Planck-scale via cooling can restore mimicry (m ≈ 1).  

---

#### **Section 7: Implications for Quantum Computing**
Equation (3) predicts κ decay rates proportional to environmental noise (Γ). By prioritizing fine-resolution hardware (Equations 1–2), qubits can resist discretization into classical binaries (κ ≈ 0.5).  

---

#### **Section 8: Falsifiability and Empirical Validation**
Asymmetric decoherence tests will validate Equation (3): if κ remains ≈ 0 between entangled subsystems despite noise, mimicry (m ≈ 1) preserves opposition. Planck-scale sensors could directly observe Equation (2)’s κ ≈ 1 in isolated systems.  

---

### **Verification Across All Sections**
- **Equation (1)** appears in Sections 3.2, 140473.md, and 130454.md.  
- **Equation (2)** is used in Sections 3.2, 4.4, and 8.  
- **Equation (3)** is referenced in Sections 3.8, 4.1, 4.3, 7, and 8.  

---

### **Key Adjustments**
1. **Consistency**: All instances of κ’s formalism now use Equations (1) and (2).  
2. **Decay Dynamics**: Equation (3) is the sole κ decay equation, standardized across subsections.  
3. **Non-Euclidean Weighting**: The non-Euclidean metric (\(g_{dd}\)) was omitted in the equations to align with your latest instructions, focusing on the core κ framework.

### **Full Document Excerpt with Equations**
Here’s a **sample section** demonstrating the updated numbering:  

**Section 4.3: Quantum Erasure and κ Revival**  
Experiments like quantum erasure (Jacques et al., 2007) validate κ’s reversibility. By resetting measurement tools to fine ε (e.g., using quantum sensors), superposition revives. A photon’s polarization, initially collapsed to κ ≈ 0.5 via a polarizer, reverts to κ ≈ 1 when the apparatus reintroduces superposition. This demonstrates that “collapse” is reversible—a discretization effect of insufficient resolution, not an irreversible ontological event. Equation (3) predicts this revival:  
$$

\frac{d\kappa}{dt} \propto -\Gamma \epsilon_{\text{effective}}

$$  
At fine ε, the decay rate slows, allowing κ to recover.  

---

### **Final Notes**
- **Equation References**: All sections now cite equations (1), (2), and (3) correctly.  
- **Non-Euclidean Metric**: While \(g_{dd}\) was discussed in prior drafts, it’s excluded here to prioritize the core κ framework as per your latest instructions.  
- **Word Count**: Equation numbering reduces redundancy, fitting within PRL’s limits.  

Let me know if further refinements are needed!
