Research neuromorphic computing focusing on ideas and innovations that are currently not being considered to facilitate commercialized and miniaturized quantum computers. Is current neuromorphic research and intellectual property considering the role of microtubules in the brain as Quantum receptor sites? And are they considering ways to transition from binary computers where the quantum State collapses to variable state observations either by using a natural Quantum process as the computer or simulating a building a Quantum computer regime simulating or building a Quantum computing machine where instead of having a binary process sort of like a dimmer switch or a Rio stat that it doesn’t need to choose a one or a zero because it’s an analog computer. What’s give me give me the lay of the land as far as essentially prior art and intellectual property/freedom to operate
