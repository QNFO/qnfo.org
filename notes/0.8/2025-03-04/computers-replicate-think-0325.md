Doing I’m creating a conceptual computer. So powerful that it will replicate the way humans actually think, which is not serialized it’s simultaneous we don’t think we think in a sequence, but that’s that’s a byproduct of this simultaneous neuronal action that that originates in Quantum receptor sites and microtubules. And in fact it’s in all living cells from photosynthesis. So right now computers have to think in in series and that slows them down. Furthermore, the way that we currently are designing quantum computers forces them to think in a binary state. So then that serialized operation now has a collapsed number of variables. I’m trying to use the power of nature where a gene expression, for example, is not just on or off. It’s any number of things. A leaf isn’t just green or not. Green has varying levels of chlorophyll. These are all continuous variables, not discreet values. That’s the key.

Furthermore, it’s extended sea extending Alan Turing’s conceptual work to binary. So it’s reversing Claude Shannon’s need for information from communication. So how to take analog communication and glean some discretized information from it. It’s exactly the opposite of that. Okay, combine that with turing’s computation machines which were limited the binary nature of the switches and Punch cards that we used as inputs. We don’t have that problem anymore. Nature doesn’t have the problem of discrete States and so I want to leverage that.
