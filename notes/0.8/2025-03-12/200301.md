Okay I think that we are confusing terms here so when I’m talking about an attractor State it’s what direction is the weight of evidence pointing okay and for string theory the attractor straight is falsifying string theory so let’s be very clear on those terms okay to say something is in an attractor state is it in an attractor State because the weight of evidence overwhelmingly points toward it or because absent distinct falsifiability criteria we can say that the weight of evidence points at an attractor State falsifying something that’s the key and also let us not confuse no evidence and the absence of falsifying criteria with a verdict to falsification okay let’s use the white swan Black swan example okay if you see no swans at all then there’s not much information there okay but if you see a Black swan then nobody cares about all the white swans all of the confirmation in the world doesn’t make sense if your model only predicts white swans does that make sense so we need to revise this again because we’re falling prey to assuming and maybe we need to State this up front falsifiability is not confirmation bias and it is not no evidence no evidence is an absent so then we can lean on if we can’t rely on falsifiability then we can look at the weight of evidence and what is the attractor State say given that weight of evidence is it leaning is it pointing toward the theoryor pointing toward its falsification that’s a lower bar than falsification but helps us understand why some things that we may never be able to falsify still have enough weight of evidence to indicate a vector and a tractor State vector either for it or against it
