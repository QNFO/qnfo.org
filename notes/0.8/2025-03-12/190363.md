MU HUGGUMMI
MU UDDUMI (Oneness of Humankind)
 - Uddum (oneness): The creator and all creation are related, all creation is connected, all creation is in all creation. It means that the creator is not separate from the creation, the creator is in the creation and the creation is in the creator, they are the same thing. For example, when you pour water into water it becomes one, it is difficult to separate them. Another example, if you put salt in water and stir it until it dissolves, it becomes one and it is very difficult to separate them, but they are not lost. Therefore, oneness means that the creator and creation are one and the same thing. They cannot be separated, but they are not lost. And that is why the Kabbalistic way of walking towards divine consciousness, is to identify oneself with all creation, so that one can identify oneself with the creator, for the creator and creation are one and the same thing.
 - Three Main Points about Uddum (Oneness):
   - The Creator and creation are related.
   - All creation is connected.
   - All creation is in all creation.
 - Relationship between Uddum and the Tree of Life:
   - Uddum is the understanding that all the 10 emanations of the Tree of Life are connected to each other and to the Ain Soph Aur (limitless light) which is the source of all creation.
   - Uddum is the understanding that all the 32 Paths of Wisdom of the Tree of Life are connected to each other and to the Ain Soph Aur (limitless light) which is the source of all creation.
   - Uddum is the understanding that all the 50 Gates of Understanding of the Tree of Life are connected to each other and to the Ain Soph Aur (limitless light) which is the source of all creation.
   - Uddum is the understanding that all the 72 names of God of the Tree of Life are connected to each other and to the Ain Soph Aur (limitless light) which is the source of all creation.
   - Uddum is the understanding that all the 231 Gates of Transformation of the Tree of Life are connected to each other and to the Ain Soph Aur (limitless light) which is the source of all creation.
   - Uddum is the understanding that all the 360 degrees of the Zodiac of the Tree of Life are connected to each other and to the Ain Soph Aur (limitless light) which is the source of all creation.
