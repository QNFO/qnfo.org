There are a lot of assumptions about some degree of magnitude baked into our assumptions about how to define resolution and compare contrast andand so instead of thinking about things on a on some kind of number line even if it’s a nonlinear number line let’s look at sick the catalytic cyclicality and that I’m representing cycles by markers okay and so instead of like representing the magnitude of a floods of a flood is high medium low or even no deer the no deer some of your many dear that’s still assumes a certain linearity or is it certain magnitude rather I’m sorry what I’m talking about here is our markers for cycles so let’s say that in comparing whenever it whenever flood happens that’s a marker and and the periodicity between them is is less important than that they happen that that and these are essentially what we call counting numbers but it’s a different way of thinking about it because the the the difference between one and two isn’t actually that relevant. And you can’t subtract flood cycles right you know you can’t you can’t subtract or let’s say I can pair notes with my neighbor and he knows that you know in his lifetime there have been you know - - or Mark Mark flood cycles and in my life which is highly observed dependent I know that there have been two so he’s more experienced he he’s been through more flood cycles but what we can’t subtract them and we can’t perform what we call math operations on them that’s ridiculous but yet here we are and we started shoehorning things into these regular intervals of measurement which I just aren’t helpful for a lot of things. where to use another example my my brother he can climb a tree and pick coconuts and I can’t yet and so that that becomes kind of a past fail then when I reach that point or let’s say that we we compare our heights on a tree but we don’t have the number system and so there’s a degree of subjectivity and resolution here how do I know when I’ve gotten to his height you know that that starts to be like xenos paradox it depends on my my perception my measurement ability and my ability to measure resolution and so certainly it helps if I can measure down to like nanometers or or things like that I’m not saying that measurement is bad or these these imposed scales are bad it’s just that it depends. and even calling resolution course medium or fine and that that implies an ordinality oh we want fine resolution well no not necessarily I mean what are you trying to measure this is where we get into things like the fractalism of trying to measure coastlines and how there’s inevitably going to be some measurement error because again Zeno’s paradox you the more in the more you increase the the resolution the the ability to measure every tiny little you know Craig and and variation then you’re going to get more information which may not be helpful so you know as with the measurement coastline problem increased resolution necessarily means that the result that you get in absolute terms is going to be greater that’s just how it works. And so then resolution becomes an inherent part of information content, it is meaningless to express it without understanding what resolution were were looking at here. That is to say expressing measurement as a quantity without also expressing resolution or defining the system by which something is quantized or quantified is not meaningful. also the cold warm hot example is interesting because it assumes a bipolar directionality I think even though we what we measure now is from what we call absolute zero but we know that particles always have spin States so that doesn’t really make a lot of sense but just like the plant constant it provides a limit that we can start to absolutely quantify that’s why it’s called absolute zero. also in the camera example we don’t need to say what the object is it can be any static object and just to the point of of argument let’s say that we have an old first generation digital camera and a modern digital camera what we’re saying is at any point if we’re capturing information with those very different resolutions the underlying reality didn’t change it’s all in our measurement. which probably explains why we think the plank constant has a bound or why absolute zero has a bound for that matter.
