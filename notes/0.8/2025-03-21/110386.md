# **Unresolved Comments and Specific Textual Changes Required**

After cross-referencing the **working draft** with the **reviewer’s comments**, the following unresolved issues remain. These changes are **not yet addressed** in the provided draft and require attention:

---

# **1. Directed Graph (Section 6)**

**Issue**: The dependency graph for gravity still references \( i \times \kappa \times \tau \) instead of the corrected \( \rho_{\text{info}}(\epsilon) \times \kappa \times \frac{d\tau}{d\epsilon} \).
**Required Change**:
Update the graph to:

```  
Existence (X)  
  ├─► Information (i)  
  │     └─► Gravity (g) ←─ [ρ_info(ε) × κ × dτ/dε]  
  │  
  └─► Change (Δi)   
        └─► Sequence (τ)  
```  

**Location**: Section 6 (Directed Graph Representation).

---

# **2. Equation Labels in Main Text**

**Issue**: Equations in the main body (e.g., Sections 4.1, 5.1) lack numbered labels (e.g., “Equation 1”), making cross-referencing impossible.
**Required Changes**:
- **Section 4.1 (Entropy)**:
  Add label:
  \[
  H_{\text{continuous}} = -\int_{\tau} p(i) \log p(i) \, di \quad (1)
  \]
- **Section 5.1 (Gravity)**:
  Add label:
  \[
  g \propto \rho_{\text{info}}(\epsilon) \cdot \kappa \cdot \frac{d\tau}{d\epsilon} \quad (2)
  \]
- **Section 5.2 (Consciousness)**:
  Add label:
  \[
  \phi \propto m \cdot \lambda \cdot \rho \quad (3)
  \]

---

# **3. Section 7.6 (Testing Continuum-Discrete Dynamics)**

**Issue**: The original comment requested a dedicated subsection (7.6) for continuum-discrete experiments, but the draft includes this content under “Testing the Continuum-Discrete Duality” without a formal subsection.
**Required Change**:
- **Add Subsection 7.6** with the following structure:

  ```  
  7.6 Testing Continuum-Discrete Dynamics  
      7.6.1 Wavefunction Collapse  
          - Prediction: \(\kappa \propto 1/\epsilon\).  
          - Experiment: Photon polarization with tunable detector resolution.  
      7.6.2 Quantum Gravity  
          - Prediction: Planck-scale spacetime quantization.  
          - Experiment: LHC upgrades to detect non-geodesic paths.  
      7.6.3 Entropy Transitions  
          - Prediction: Quantized entropy jumps in black hole analogs.  
  ```  

**Location**: After Section 7.5 (Consciousness Testing).

# **4. URL and ORCID Formatting**

**Issue**: The ORCID link in the header contains a space (`0009 -0002-4317-5604`), and the website URL may need verification.
**Required Changes**:
- **ORCID**: Remove the space:

  ```  
  ORCID: https://orcid.org/0009-0002-4317-5604  
  ```  

- **Website**: Verify `http://qnfo.org` resolves correctly (no action needed if functional).

---

# **5. Gravity Equation in Section 5.1**

**Issue**: While the equation uses \( \frac{d\tau}{d\epsilon} \), the accompanying text does not explicitly state that \( \rho_{\text{info}} \) depends on \( \epsilon \).
**Required Change**:
Add clarification in **Section 5.1**:

> “Gravity arises from information density (\( \rho_{\text{info}}(\epsilon) \)), contrast (\( \kappa \)), and the rate of sequence progression relative to resolution (\( \frac{d\tau}{d\epsilon} \)).”

---

# **Summary Of Unresolved Edits**

| **Section** | **Change** |
|--------------|------------|
| Section 6 | Update gravity dependencies to \( \rho_{\text{info}}(\epsilon) \times \kappa \times \frac{d\tau}{d\epsilon} \). |
| Sections 4.1, 5.1, 5.2 | Add numbered equation labels (1), (2), (3). |
| Section 7 | Add formal subsection 7.6 for continuum-discrete experiments. |
| Header | Fix ORCID formatting. |
| Section 5.1 | Clarify \( \rho_{\text{info}}(\epsilon) \) dependency. |

These changes ensure **full alignment** with the reviewer’s feedback while preserving resolved updates (e.g., references, equation fixes). No prior work is undone.
