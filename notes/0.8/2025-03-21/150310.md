I would love to know how you think you can take log sums of emojis and pictograms see there’s the there’s the issue right we can’t just rely on numeric man and so what does that mean does that mean that we’re transcending math all together or that we can still Express these concepts and it’s in its language math is a kind of constructed language you know so where’s that leave us because you know we risk kind of having to abandon this whole thing for not being able to describe it in precise enough terms and yet math with its flaws can’t also provide the breadth that something like language or logic can so that would suggest we’re back at logic then as or or that you know we have to simply acknowledge things in terms of their existence or non-existence when defining these quantities but resolution can’t simply be has to be a set that’s just existing or non-existent it has to be more than just a set that is ask me more than just a set that is Boolean but now wheeler might come back into Play because can we then take something like a hierarchical comparison right a hierarchical comparison that that then is is sort of like a decision tree yeah that’s what it from bit is that all of these things boil down the yes or no questions that can define existence so maybe we need to lean more on on Wheeler to define these these primitives in terms of yes no questions it might not be as simple as adding numbers together to provide a proof and exhaustive framework. We may have to assess something to the extent of okay are they the same you know in terms of properties can we have a property without a comparison there’s a good one so can we have a property without a comparison either a sequence comparing it to a previous state or comparing it to something else another state that that might that might make things more interesting for this what are we comparing to when we when we determine these things are we comparing sort of internally or or externally move that kind of adds some some additional complexity here that we should address. Number simplify this of course you know we can compare numbers themselves is a five or is star star duck duck is that the same as something else or is it the same as really I think we then need to to rethink what we mean by different types of comparisons like interval categorical and ordinal we can there’s an ontology there that I think we can unpack without resorting to those labels labels are convenient models for underlying ontology. we may have to first try to paper on the ontology of numbers and math to really grasp this from a more fundamental it from bit or informational perspective.
