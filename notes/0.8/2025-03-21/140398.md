Since you’re saying that everything is information then so too it becomes a little more challenging to provide mathematic proofs when numbers themselves can be broken down into more fundamental information essentially numbers are forms of sequence and contrast we acknowledge in our constructive number system that two comes after one except except we messed it up because zero doesn’t actually come before one one is really a limit that approaches what we consider zero but never really gets there so that’s why we get these issues with singularities is that there’s a limit there you know it’s essentially calculus viewer doesn’t really exist and then when we invert that over into negative numbers that’s a whole different dimension that we’re now trying to shoehorn on the same vector plane. since resolution in the information Dynamics framework is observer dependent that starts to get it things like measurements and the information or I’m sorry and the measurement paradox of quantum mechanics which quite frankly is problematic in the first place trying to reduce informational Dynamics into discrete quanta IE particles even though it’s ridiculous the photon doesn’t have mass but is considered a particle just to resolve it’s the inherent problems of of physical framework. Also to really illustrate this idea of numbers as symbols whose intervals represent whatever we say they do especially when it becomes to the difference between zero and one and it’s nonlinearity compared to say one to two or even one and negative one then we should rely on pictograms to illustrate how these these comparisons these contrast and sequences happen before the current number system and so use emojis in that case to represent these these items and distinguish the resolution of saying oh one versus 10 versus zero or 10 versus 100 or 10 versus 20 you know that’s where cultures start to get into this idea of none some many they don’t make that same distinction that we do and it doesn’t really matter how many. Let’s keep in mind that our Western number system is not the only way of thinking about things like quantity and resolution
