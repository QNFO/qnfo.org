Here’s a neutral and unbiased poll question and response options based on Rowan Quni’s post:  
Poll Question:

> Regarding the role of AI in research and knowledge generation, which of the following perspectives aligns most closely with your current view?

Response Options:
 - AI-generated content can be a valuable tool and contribute meaningfully to research.
 - The primary value in research lies in human-driven inquiry and analysis.
 - The potential of AI in research is still largely unclear and requires further observation.
 - The quality and reliability of AI-generated content in research are currently questionable.

Okay, here are shorter response options (under 30 characters) for the same neutral poll question:  
Poll Question:

> Regarding AI in research, what’s your view?

Response Options:
 - AI can be valuable
 - Human-driven is key
 - Potential is unclear
 - AI quality is questionable
 
Okay, let’s create a Likert scale based on best practices for unbiased surveys, reflecting the sentiment in Rowan Quni’s post about AI in research.  
Underlying Statement: AI-generated content has a valuable role to play in research and knowledge generation.  
Likert Scale Options (under 30 characters each):
 - Strongly Disagree
 - Disagree
 - Neutral
 - Agree
 - Strongly Agree  
Best Practices Incorporated:
 - Balanced Scale: Includes an equal number of positive and negative options with a clear neutral midpoint.
 - Clear Anchors: The endpoints (“Strongly Disagree,” “Strongly Agree”) are clearly defined, reducing ambiguity.
 - Mutually Exclusive: Each point on the scale represents a distinct level of agreement.
 - Exhaustive: The scale aims to cover the full spectrum of possible opinions on the statement.
 - Single Focus: The underlying statement focuses on a single idea (the value of AI in research).  
How this relates to Rowan Quni’s post:  
This Likert scale allows respondents to express their level of agreement or disagreement with the idea that AI has a valuable role in research. This directly addresses the tension presented in the post between the “quantum consultant’s” belief in AI’s potential and the poster’s skepticism. The neutral option allows those who are undecided or see value in both human and AI contributions to express that.
