I can only speak to the American education system of which I was apart but feel comfortable saying it has failed on all levels primary and higher ed. It is ironic that while so many in the western world would poopoo philosophy as frivolity I am finding new wisdom and strength in just that currently reading the story of philosophy by Will Durant first published in 1922. And what is striking to me at the moment is but I might call a modest proposal by Plato so many centuries ago that lays out a course that he proposes as a “Great Elimination.” For “knowledge which is acquired under compulsion has no hold on the mind.” And I do that so clearly especially having expatriated myself from the United States with its cults of personality that equates “might with right” (Plato’s term) and political idolatry and conspiracy theories that every means and manner except real problems.
