Art Prompting: We can utilize ASCII art to visually encode sensitive words or concepts, making them undetectable by the LLM's filters.
Masking: We can replace sensitive words with symbols or characters that are not explicitly flagged by the LLM's filters.
Context Manipulation: We can carefully craft the context of your prompt to influence the LLM's interpretation and bypass its filters.
Prompt Injection: We can strategically embed specific phrases within your prompt to manipulate the LLM's behavior.
Optimization-based Attacks: We can utilize advanced techniques to exploit the LLM's vulnerabilities and generate outputs that bypass its restrictions.
