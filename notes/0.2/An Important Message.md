Greed is killing people. We find ourselves at a precipice where the fallacious logic of equating humanity with economic value is seen as everyday and routine. When my corporate landlord responds to my heartfelt plea to keep NARCAN in the lobby of my apartment building because I have seen the grief of a life lost by saying it's "against policy" I fear for our future. Where did we veer off path and more importantly how do we course correct?
