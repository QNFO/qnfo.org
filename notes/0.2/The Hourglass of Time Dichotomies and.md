It only is time not linear, but also goes forward and reverses in counterintuitive and unexpected ways that really fundamentally changed what we know, for example, we perceive things that we have thoughts to drive our actions. But what I'd call the John Malkovich effect, it's the other way around, we're just observers of our own reality and so yeah. There is one of those inversions of time we just don't expect and what that does work. It's really interesting is when we throw free will and preordination or Einstein's block universe in there. Now, all of a sudden, what we're perceiving as one is the other, so what that means is that, according to a class from a macroscopic, and here's where the micromezo macro comes in certain inversions. Eternity, and the universe are like an hourglass constant inversions in different dimensions, and so what that means is from macro scale, classical physics would tell us the universe is already written. And that's Einstein's walking verse, but it turns out that the The Pass is already written. Because it already happened, but we do have free will because of our misperception of direction. It's truly mind-bending, but those inversions there with the right entity relationships between the dichotomy of free will and preordination, and the forward and reversibility of time, as well as with micro/macro scales and also our misperceptions about thoughts and actions driving each other.

In this expanded outline, a Coda section (IX) has been added to address the constraints on our limits to understanding our own ignorance. The section begins by discussing Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem and its implications for our understanding of existence, highlighting the inherent limitations of formal systems and the individual's bounded understanding in the face of the vast universe.

The Coda then explores the importance of overcoming ego and recognizing cognitive shortcomings, emphasizing the value of intellectual humility, embracing uncertainty, and acknowledging the unknown. It draws upon the ideas of historical figures such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle to underscore the potential for growth and discovery through acknowledging ignorance and the fundamental human drive to explore and understand.

The ongoing quest to unravel the deeper mysteries of reality is discussed, highlighting the role of curiosity and wonder in scientific and philosophical inquiry, as well as the importance of collaboration and the sharing of knowledge. The section concludes with remarks on the journey of understanding and the beauty of the unknown, encouraging readers to embrace the complexity and mystery of existence and recognizing the potential for personal growth and transformation through the pursuit of knowledge.
