Closer to the freegan economy, where if I have something i’m willing to give you because you want it then I don’t need anything in return. There’s a macroeconomic equilibrium. at least that’s the utopian concept. and what about necessities that everyone needs like housing, healthcare, and food? Well there’s a lot of nuance in there.What kind of housing: a modest flat or a palatial suburban mcmansion; and what kind of food: sufficiently tasty and appropriate caloric value or some exclusive caviar from a nearly extinct sturgeon or coffee beans picked in small batches on one farm, halfway across the world?
