What’s the difference between receiving, acknowledging, interpreting, and synthesizing communication? admittedly, this is a bit of a forced construct, but think of foreign language communication. It’s easier to understand hearing a foreign language than it is to speak a foreign language because in some ways, speaking is additional cognitive load before you can speak, you have to understand what it is you wish to speak, whereas hearing is unidirectional..

So too with information in general and the ways that we communicate. receiving any communication can be a passive act. We’re bombarded with information signals and stimuli constantly, and most of it necessarily flows “ in one ear and out the other” without conscious processing to function at more essential tasks.

But if all communication were passive we would be missing part of the information spectrum for bidirectional information exchange. Acknowledging, verbally, nonverbally--perhaps even telepathically--that we’ve received a communication provides error correction and allows for redundancy in case part of the message wuzmist, think about active listening when we repeat back what we’ve heard to assure the source of the communication can assign a high confidence that the message was received correctly as intended.

And its least useful and counterproductve though acknowledging devolves to reflexive “mmhmm” and “yeah” filler gestures that don’t convey useful meaning ( except perhaps ironically, but that’s a different subject on the all-too-common bastardization of communication).

So what to do? How do we error correct for that given that John Wheeler’s it from bit proposes the entire universe can be understood as boolean Yes/no True/False. What happens when we can’t rely on the quality of those answers?

We need redundancy, we need more layers of communication.

We’ve already talked about active communication as interpreting. here too. There are plenty of pitfalls, depending on whether the communication sender has the opportunity to verify or weather like so much of our broadcast media end, digital lives. Our messages are broadcast, and so if I watch the news or read a Twitter Post, I can either passage Acknowledge or receive a message? Or I can even think critically about it bud, it becomes difficult for the initial sender to verify even if they wanted to. nR day of truthiness and double speak in fake news. In an alarming number of cases, the initial intent is to deceive, or at least
Communicate ignorance effectively, and this leads to the bizarre multiparty communication air another party daint itself “fact checker” that’s even more complexity likely needless

Which brings us to the apex of our communication pyramid, which is to synthesize, this is called learning or knowledge transfer, and is the heart of our conventional systems of information education and dissemination
