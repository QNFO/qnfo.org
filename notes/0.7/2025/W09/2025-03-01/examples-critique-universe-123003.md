# Examples Are Not Rules

**A Critique of Empirical Accumulation and the Case for the Informational Universe Hypothesis**

---

## **Abstract**

Modern science often prioritizes cataloging empirical observations (examples) over uncovering foundational principles (rules). This paper critiques this “zoo of examples” approach, particularly in physics, chemistry, and the study of human imagination, and argues that the **Informational Universe Hypothesis (IUH)**—which posits information as the universe’s fundamental constituent—offers a path toward rule-based unification. By applying set theory and category theory, we expose the limitations of example-driven frameworks and advocate for a shift toward explanatory principles.

## **1. Introduction: The Crisis of Empirical Accumulation**

Science has historically relied on accumulating empirical data (e.g., particles, chemical compounds, narratives) to describe reality. However, these examples lack explanatory power:
- **Physics**: The Standard Model lists particles but fails to explain *why* they exist or how they emerge from deeper principles.
- **Chemistry**: The periodic table organizes elements but cannot predict their properties or resolve anomalies (e.g., lanthanides’ placement).
- **Cognition**: Shared fictions (e.g., money, myths) are cataloged but not derived from universal rules.

The **IUH**—rooted in quantum information theory and digital physics—proposes that information is the …
