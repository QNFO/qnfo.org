Xanadu has developed the Borealis system, which demonstrated “quantum advantage” by solving challenging mathematical problems at previously unattainable speeds, and Aurora, a quantum system that uses light-based qubits for quantum processing.
There are several paradigms of photonic qubits currently being researched, including:
Squeezed states: These trade off Heisenberg uncertainty, decreasing uncertainty for some phases at the expense of increasing uncertainty for other phases.
Dual-rail encoding: This uses two paths, aka “modes,” one designated 0 and one designated 1, and the paths the photons take determine the measurement outcomes.
Qumodes: These use integrated optics and waveguides and rely on quantum tunneling to allow photons to pass from one waveguide to another.
