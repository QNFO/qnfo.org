# **Scope Of Prior Art Search**

The prior art search should focus on identifying existing disclosures that could impact the **novelty** or **non-obviousness** of the inventions in the consolidated patents. Key areas include:

1. **Technical Domains**:
   - **Bio-inspired quantum processor designs** (e.g., microtubule-like lattices, CMOS-compatible fabrication) [[1], [3], [9]].
   - **Liquid dielectrics for quantum systems** (e.g., hydrogen-bonded mixtures like water/glycerol, additives such as trehalose) [[1], [6]].
   - **Ambient-temperature quantum operation** (e.g., high-temperature superconductors, cryogenics-free cooling) [[1], [9]].
   - **Decoherence control systems** (e.g., non-Markovian noise engineering, terahertz pulse generators) [[3], [7]].

2. **Search Sources**:
   - Patent databases (USPTO, EPO, CNIPA, WIPO) for granted patents and applications [[3], [6]].
   - Non-patent literature (scientific journals, conference proceedings, preprints) on quantum biology, superconductors, and nanostructured materials [[3], [6], [9]].

3. **Key Terms**:
   - “Bio-inspired quantum shielding,” “hydrogen-bonded dielectrics,” “CMOS-integrated qubits,” “non-Markovian noise control” [[1], [6], [9]].

# **Scope Of Freedom-to-Operate (FTO) Search**

The FTO search must identify **active patents** that could block commercialization in target jurisdictions (US, EU, China). Focus areas include:

1. **Technical Overlaps**:
   - **Liquid cooling/shielding systems** (e.g., IBM’s cryogenic fluid patents, liquid dielectrics in electronics) [[4], [10]].
   - **Noise-driven quantum computing** (e.g., D-Wave’s annealing systems, terahertz-based control systems) [[4], [7]].
   - **Modular quantum devices** (e.g., swappable “quantum cartridges,” handheld quantum sensors) [[notes/0.3/2024/11/10/index]].

2. **Jurisdictional Analysis**:
   - Check patents in the **US, EU, and China** with active status (not expired or abandoned) [[8], [10]].
   - Review unpublished applications (filed within the last 18 months) that may later pose risks [[notes/0.6/2025/02/7/7]].

3. **Risk Mitigation**:
   - Validate legal status of identified patents (e.g., expiry dates, licensing opportunities) [[8]].
   - Design around claims related to “liquid-phase deposition” or “adaptive decoherence control” if conflicts arise [[4], [10]].

This dual approach ensures alignment with both patentability requirements and commercial viability in mobile quantum computing markets.
