The problem with so-called technology is its assumption that there’s a problem. It can solve fire is technology, and certainly did solve a lot of our problems, but let us not become too fine grain or else. Risk losing the insight that by converging, toward a point of view, infinite technology or technological solutions. We may be, in fact, at the asymptote of the end of civilization

By way, of example, radio and television have brought communication to the masses. But I have been no poorer for being off.Social media and severely limiting my youtube use

In the home dishwasher and washing machine were said to liberate women from domesticity and get the year I spent without a dishwasher was in fact just fine and I willingly gave up a smaller unit for the counter space instead of having a and I sore with maintenance problems. To load and unload, wash had been done. Buy a laundry service because of a free incentive. But now that I am left to my own laundry.I will think much more carefully about what I wear and my time considerations

But here is what I really mean, what we call artificial intelligence? Is it transformational step in human communication? The closest equivalents are language itself invented by the nomadic Aramaic traitors and movable. Type the printing press in the 14th century by Johann scutenberg. Carnegie’s libraries did wonders for literacy, as well as free public. Education and so too, we find ourselves with a big solution, but also lots of little problems that think they’re solving a solution, hardly a discussion or Billboard or advertisement, doesn’t Trump AI something or other. And yet, these amount a little more than lipstick on a pig

My message is simple. We should be clear a problem. Statement precedes a solution, not the other way around. Take the beach, for example, as a resident of San Francisco I love the Rocky beaches that are pleasant and crowded and sociable, but also at high tide introversible. With waves lapping against the small Rocky shoreline, hugging the toast near the Golden Gate Bridge, where I frequent.

When I first arrived as a novice, I thought there should be an app for that by a simple combination of ambient air temperature and tides and sunset and fog. Perhaps even a social component, I could find the perfect time to arrive at the beach and that was my problem. There is no perfect time. This is manifesting my own reality, what it means to me, to be perfect, and my own ignorance that there could ever be an imperfect time to see nature. Edit’s raw finest, where cargo container ships coming into the port of Oakland seemed trivial and insignificant even compared to the majesty of the Golden Gate Bridge. And by thinking that there was a problem, I would prevent myself from experiencing the beach at its most pristine As I did today, when I arrived by happenstance, at the very highest tide I had ever seen, we’re only a small patch of rockiers, prevented me from drowning in the waves and where

Perhaps you could summarize the main points you’re trying to convey in a more concise way? That would allow me to better understand and respond to your thoughts.

The repeated paragraphs are an artifact of dictation with obsidian, the note taking software. I’m using what I’d like is for you to mimic my tone in my voice. Expanding these thoughts into an essa

> The Paradox of Technological Solutions
> In our relentless pursuit of progress, we’ve become enamored with the idea that technology can solve all our problems. But what if the very assumption that there’s a problem to be solved is itself the problem? This paradoxical notion has been gnawing at me lately, especially as I reflect on my experiences in San Francisco.
> Take fire, for instance. Undoubtedly, the mastery of fire solved countless problems for our ancestors. But as we’ve grown more sophisticated, our solutions have become increasingly granular, often missing the forest for the trees. We’re converging on a point where technological solutions are infinite, yet we may be approaching the asymptote of civilization’s end.
> Consider the ubiquity of communication technology. Radio and television brought information to the masses, but I’ve found myself no poorer for limiting my social media use and YouTube consumption. In the domestic sphere, dishwashers and washing machines were touted as liberators of women from household drudgery. Yet, during a year without a dishwasher, I found the task of washing dishes by hand perfectly manageable. I even opted for more counter space over a smaller dishwasher unit, sparing myself the headache of maintenance issues.
> Now, we find ourselves in the age of artificial intelligence, heralded as a transformative step in human communication. Its closest historical equivalents might be the invention of language itself by nomadic Aramaic traders or the development of movable type by Johann Gutenberg in the 14th century. While Carnegie’s libraries and free public education undoubtedly advanced literacy, we now face a plethora of AI-driven “solutions” that often amount to little more than lipstick on a pig.
> My message is simple: a clear problem statement should precede a solution, not the other way around. As a San Francisco resident, I’ve come to love the rocky beaches near the Golden Gate Bridge. They’re crowded, sociable, and at high tide, almost inaccessible. When I first arrived, I naively thought there should be an app to determine the perfect time to visit based on factors like temperature, tides, sunset, and fog. But I’ve since realized that there is no perfect time. By seeking to solve a non-existent problem, I was robbing myself of the chance to experience nature in all its raw, unpredictable beauty.
> The majesty of cargo ships entering the Port of Oakland pales in comparison to the timeless grandeur of the Golden Gate Bridge. By fixating on optimizing my beach visits, I was nearly preventing myself from witnessing the beach at its most pristine – as I did today, arriving by chance at the highest tide I’d ever seen, with only a small patch of rocks between me and the crashing waves.
> In our rush to solve every perceived inconvenience, we risk losing sight of the profound experiences that arise from embracing imperfection and chance. Perhaps it’s time we step back and question whether every aspect of our lives truly needs a technological solution. In doing so, we might just rediscover the beauty in the unoptimized, the unexpected, and the wonderfully imperfect world around us.
