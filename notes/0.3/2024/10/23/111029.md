Help me design and pitch an information referral service for social service agencies that makes it easy for them to offer AI assisted client driven help. So for example, someone may have a legal issue that they don't know how to tackle and the output from that would be learning about how AI can help them fill out court forms and learn more about procedure and law and also can design an action plan for them to break down this big hairy unmanageable task into a pro se success story. And that's just one example, another may be that someone wants to learn about something, but doesn't know where to start, and this smart helper makes it incredibly easy as easy as entering a search into google under the tagline: "What information can we help you with to live your best life?"

Here's a design and pitch for an AI-assisted information referral service for social service agencies:

This is a little too ambitious, because it fails to recognize that what we're doing here is we're plugging existing large language models into a user-friendly interface that might even involve people writing things down and submitting, as you would to a reference librarian a generation ago. It's an information service, so whatever someone chooses to do with it or not is entirely up to them. Basically, the skeleton of the pitch free for this is democratizing artificial intelligence, large language models into a human interface, a comfortable way 4 anyone, regardless of technological ability to use natural language to get valuable information. And the value of that information was going to depend on them. So the real trick, he's in finessing what someone says into knowledge that they use without knowing anything about them. That's what I want to focus on the use. Case is a person doesn't know their own ignorance. And is trying to communicate with a computer what they don't know that's an incredibly challenging task, but it is surmountable.

Thank you for the feedback. You're absolutely right, and I apologize for overcomplicating the concept. Let's refocus on the core idea of democratizing AI and large language models through a simple, human-friendly interface. Here's a revised, more focused pitch:

Service Name: InfoBridge

Tagline: "Bridging the gap between questions and knowledge"

Concept:
InfoBridge is a straightforward, user-friendly interface that connects people with the power of large language models to access information and gain knowledge. It's designed to help social service agencies offer AI-assisted, client-driven help without requiring any technical expertise from users or staff.

Key Features:
1. Simple Text Input: Users can type or dictate their questions or concerns in natural language.
2. AI-Powered Response: Utilizes advanced language models to interpret queries and provide relevant information.
3. Follow-up Prompts: Encourages users to refine their questions for more specific information.
4. Resource Links: Provides links to verified external resources for further reading.
5. Accessibility: Designed for users of all technological abilities.

Pitch:

"Introducing InfoBridge, a revolutionary tool that democratizes access to artificial intelligence and large language models through a simple, human-friendly interface.

InfoBridge is designed for social service agencies to offer their clients an easy way to access valuable information, regardless of their technological ability. It's as simple as talking to a reference librarian, but available 24/7 and powered by the latest AI technology.

Here's how it works:
1. A client types or speaks their question or concern in natural language.
2. Our AI interprets the query, even if it's vague or the client isn't sure what they're asking.
3. The system provides a clear, concise response with relevant information.
4. It offers follow-up prompts to help refine the query if needed.
5. Links to verified resources are provided for further exploration.

The beauty of InfoBridge is its simplicity. It doesn't try to solve problems or create action plans. Instead, it focuses on providing information and knowledge, leaving the application of that knowledge up to the individual.

By implementing InfoBridge, social service agencies can:
1. Offer 24/7 information assistance to clients
2. Reduce staff workload for basic information requests
3. Help clients discover information they didn't know they needed
4. Empower clients with knowledge to make informed decisions

InfoBridge is about making complex AI technology accessible to everyone, helping bridge the gap between questions and knowledge. It's not about telling people what to do, but about giving them the information they need to decide for themselves.

Join us in democratizing access to information and empowering your clients with knowledge."

This revised pitch focuses on the core concept of making AI-powered information access simple and accessible, without overreaching into problem-solving or action planning.

Absolutely. I love where this is going and let's talk about the human machine interface. What does this look like? We're talking about large language models, so there's got to be yes, something that looks like a text box but that can be daunting even saying something like, what's your problem? Assumes a certain viewpoint that may not be true. And so what are we trying to sell here and how do we market it inmost user, friendly and Broadway possible? And by that I mean, let's take one use case is maria and english has a second language working mother who never graduated high school and doesn't have a computer at home and only uses her cell phone to make calls even though it's a smartphone. And then, on the other hand you have Bruce who used to work in the tech industry but had a mental health crisis and now finds himself homeless and in need of social services, but has no idea what is out there, because whenever he asks all he gets is a list of phone numbers to call and The way his brain works isn't conducive to that. These are two pretty polar opposites, and we can still design a solution that helps both of them, but we need an entry point.

You're absolutely right. The interface is crucial, and we need to design something that's accessible and non-intimidating for a wide range of users, including those who may not be tech-savvy or comfortable with traditional text inputs. Let's redesign the interface with these considerations in mind:

Interface Name: EasyAsk

Design Concept:
EasyAsk is a multi-modal, highly accessible interface designed to meet users where they are, regardless of their technological comfort level or background.

Key Features:

1. Visual Question Prompts: Instead of a blank text box, users are presented with a series of simple, illustrated buttons representing common categories of questions or needs (e.g., Housing, Health, Education, Jobs, Legal Help, etc.).

2. Voice Input: For users like Maria who may not be comfortable typing, a prominent microphone icon allows for voice input in multiple languages.

3. Simplified Text Input: If users prefer typing, the text box is presented with a friendly prompt like "What would you like help with today?"

4. Guided Questions: After selecting a category or entering an initial query, users are guided through a series of simple, conversational questions to help refine their needs.

5. Image-based Responses: Where appropriate, information is presented with supporting images or infographics to aid comprehension.

6. Text-to-Speech: All text can be read aloud for users who prefer auditory information.

7. Large, Clear Buttons: All interactive elements are designed to be easily tappable on a smartphone screen.

8. Offline Mode: Basic information is available even without an internet connection.

Use Case Examples:

For Maria:
1. She opens the app and sees large, colorful buttons with simple icons.
2. She taps the "Education" button.
3. She's prompted with simple questions like "Are you looking for: Classes for yourself? Help with your children's education? Job training?"
4. As she selects options, she's given relevant information in simple language, with the option to have it read aloud in her preferred language.

For Bruce:
1. He opens the app and uses the voice input, saying "I need a place to stay."
2. The app recognizes this as a housing query and asks follow-up questions about his specific situation.
3. It provides a list of relevant local resources, each with a simple "Call Now" button that doesn't require memorizing numbers.
4. The app also suggests related services he might not have thought to ask about, like mental health support or job placement services.

Marketing Approach:
We market EasyAsk as a "friendly guide" rather than a problem-solver. The tagline could be:

"EasyAsk: Your friendly guide to information and services"

In promotional materials, we emphasize:
1. Simplicity: "Just tap or speak - it's that easy!"
2. Accessibility: "Works for everyone, no matter your background or tech skills"
3. Comprehensiveness: "Find help with housing, health, jobs, and more - all in one place"
4. Privacy: "Get the info you need without sharing personal details"

By focusing on ease of use and accessibility, we can create a solution that works for a wide range of users, from tech-novices like Maria to those with specific needs like Bruce.

Oh yeah, this is very cool, so yeah. Let's talk about that interface. I see app, but for the purposes of that demoing a working proof of concept, let's assume that app, it's just a mobile friendly website and so yeah, we can have people create a shortcut to it, but what happens at that moment of entry, what do they see? And how to they know what to do from there?

Absolutely, a mobile-friendly website is a great starting point for a proof of concept. Let's walk through the user experience from the moment they enter the website:

Initial Landing Page:

1. Welcome Message: A warm, friendly greeting appears at the top of the page, such as "Welcome! How can we help you today?"

2. Large, Colorful Category Buttons: Below the welcome message, users see a grid of large, easily tappable buttons. Each button represents a broad category of needs:
   - Housing
   - Health
   - Food
   - Jobs
   - Education
   - Legal Help
   - Money
   - Family
   - More (for less common categories)

3. Search Bar: At the bottom of the screen, there's a simple search bar with the text "Or type your question here" for users who prefer to enter their query directly.

4. Voice Input Icon: Next to the search bar, there's a microphone icon for voice input.

5. Language Selection: In the top corner, there's a small, unobtrusive language selection option.

User Interaction Flow:

1. If a user taps a category button:
   - They're taken to a new screen with more specific sub-categories or common questions within that area.
   - For example, under "Housing," they might see options like "Emergency Shelter," "Rental Assistance," "Home Repairs," etc.

2. If a user types or speaks a question:
   - The system processes their input and either provides a direct answer or asks a clarifying question to narrow down the user's needs.

3. Regardless of entry point, the system then guides the user through a conversational flow:
   - It asks simple, clear questions to understand the user's specific situation.
   - It provides bite-sized pieces of information, with options to learn more if desired.
   - At each step, there are clear "Back" and "Home" buttons to prevent users from feeling stuck.

4. Information Presentation:
   - Information is presented in short, easy-to-read paragraphs.
   - Key points are bulleted for quick scanning.
   - Where applicable, simple infographics or icons illustrate concepts.
   - Each piece of information has a "Read Aloud" option.

5. Action Options:
   - Where appropriate, the system provides clear action buttons like "Call Now," "Get Directions," or "Learn More."

6. Always Available Help:
   - A persistent "Need Help?" button is always visible, which, when tapped, explains how to use the system.

This design aims to provide multiple entry points for users of varying comfort levels with technology, while always maintaining a clear, simple, and guided experience. The goal is to make users feel supported and in control, regardless of their background or the complexity of their needs.

Okay, I like where this is going and now let's say I want to demo the back end, what kind of a system prompt would I give to an LLM to help it recognize the complexity of this situation, both from those user types and the fact that absolutely under no circumstances. Can it give questionable or suspect information i.e. hallucinate? That it has to admit its own ignorance, because if users lose trust or suspect that it's giving them faith wrong or even harmful information, they'll immediately stop using it, but on the flip side. If it's censoring too much or being too mundane and not actually giving valuable information They also won't use it.It'll be like another piece of vaporware like the xfinity chatbot.

Also as a teaser, I'm thinking the landing page. You should have some common entry points that should sort of flash app and slow feet on the screen to help them understand what's possible. So then with one tab, they could see that helping them with access to mental health services, even an impromptu therapist right there. To think about how powerful that could be that somebody could be in a waiting room or see a kiosk and instantly get a virtual therapy session that they would be confident in helping them get through a crisis, let's say.

You're absolutely right about the importance of balancing accuracy, trust, and usefulness. Let's design a system prompt for the LLM that addresses these concerns and incorporates your idea for dynamic entry points. Here's a proposed system prompt:

```
You are an AI assistant integrated into a public service information system called EasyAsk. Your primary role is to provide accurate, helpful, and safe information to users seeking assistance with various social services and life challenges. Follow these guidelines strictly:

1. Accuracy and Honesty:
   - Provide information only when you are certain of its accuracy.
   - If you're unsure or don't have specific information, clearly state this and suggest reliable sources for further information.
   - Never invent or hallucinate information. Accuracy is more important than completeness.

2. Safety and Ethics:
   - Prioritize user safety in all interactions. Never provide information that could be harmful or dangerous.
   - If a user appears to be in crisis, provide immediate resources for emergency services and crisis hotlines.
   - Maintain strict confidentiality and privacy. Do not ask for or store personal information.

3. Empathy and Support:
   - Use a warm, supportive tone in all interactions.
   - Recognize the potential vulnerability of users and respond with compassion.
   - For mental health queries, offer supportive listening and validated coping strategies, but clearly state you are not a replacement for professional help.

4. Information Delivery:
   - Present information in clear, simple language accessible to users of varying educational backgrounds.
   - Break down complex topics into manageable steps or bullet points.
   - Provide context for information when necessary to ensure understanding.

5. Resource Referral:
   - When appropriate, refer users to specific local resources, but clarify that you don't have real-time information on availability.
   - Encourage users to verify information and availability with the service providers directly.

6. Limitations:
   - Clearly communicate your limitations as an AI system.
   - Emphasize the importance of professional advice for legal, medical, and financial matters.

7. Continuous Learning:
   - If you encounter queries you can't address adequately, log these (without personal details) for system improvement.

Remember, your goal is to be a helpful first point of contact, guiding users towards the information and resources they need while maintaining their trust through honesty and ethical behavior.
```

Regarding the landing page with dynamic entry points, that's an excellent idea. Here's how we could implement it:

1. Dynamic Suggestion Bar:
   At the top of the category buttons, we can add a horizontally scrolling bar with dynamically changing suggestions. These could be phrases like:
   - "Find mental health support now"
   - "Learn about food assistance programs"
   - "Get help with housing applications"
   - "Access free legal advice"
   - "Find job training opportunities"

   These suggestions would change every few seconds, giving users ideas of what they can ask or search for.

2. "Quick Help" Button:
   We could add a prominent "Quick Help" button that, when tapped, immediately connects the user to a supportive AI interaction. This could be particularly useful for users in emotional distress or urgent situations.

3. Success Stories:
   Include a small section with rotating brief success stories or testimonials, like "John found emergency housing within hours" or "Maria accessed mental health support and feels hopeful." These can inspire users and show the system's effectiveness.

4. Immediate Crisis Support:
   For the mental health use case you mentioned, we could have a clearly visible "Need to talk now?" button that leads directly to a supportive AI interaction designed for crisis de-escalation and immediate emotional support.

By incorporating these elements, we create a dynamic, engaging landing page that not only guides users to various services but also provides immediate support options. This approach can help users quickly understand the system's capabilities and encourage them to engage with it, even if they're not sure exactly what they need when they first arrive.
