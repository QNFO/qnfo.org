To completely remove Windows and set up your computer to run Linux, follow these steps:

1. Back up important data: Ensure you've saved all important files from your Windows system.

2. Create a Linux bootable USB drive:
   - Download your preferred Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, Mint).
   - Use a tool like Rufus or Etcher to create a bootable USB drive.

3. Boot from the Linux USB:
   - Restart your computer and enter the BIOS/UEFI settings (usually by pressing F2, F12, or Del during startup).
   - Change the boot order to prioritize USB boot.
   - Save and exit BIOS/UEFI.

4. Start the Linux live environment:
   - Choose "Try Linux" or similar option to boot into the live environment.

5. Open the disk utility:
   - In Ubuntu, it's called "GParted" or "Disks".

6. Delete all existing partitions:
   - This includes Windows partitions, recovery partitions, and any other partitions.
   - Warning: This will erase all data on the drive.

7. Create new partitions for Linux:
   - Create an EFI partition (if using UEFI boot).
   - Create a root partition (/).
   - Create a swap partition (optional).
   - Create a home partition (/home) (optional).

8. Apply the changes to the disk.

9. Start the Linux installation process:
   - Choose "Install Linux" from the desktop or menu.
   - Follow the installation wizard.
   - When prompted for installation type, choose "Something else" or "Manual partitioning".
   - Assign the newly created partitions to their respective mount points.

10. Complete the installation:
    - Set up your user account, timezone, etc.
    - Let the installer complete the process.

11. Reboot your computer:
    - Remove the USB drive when prompted.

12. Post-installation:
    - Update your system.
    - Install additional software as needed.

This process will completely remove Windows and set up your computer to run Linux. Be aware that this process is irreversible and will delete all data on your hard drive, so ensure you have backups of important files before proceeding.
