Is it possible that entanglement may occur as a result of electronic communications instead of or in addition to physical proximity? I understand that entanglement doesn't require physical proximity, but it does require coherence, right? So under what conditions can that occur?

This is an intriguing question that touches on some complex aspects of quantum mechanics. To address it, let's break it down into parts and clarify some key concepts.

1. Entanglement basics:
Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of the others, even when separated by large distances.

2. Physical proximity:
You're correct that entanglement doesn't necessarily require physical proximity. Particles can be entangled and then separated by large distances while maintaining their entangled state.

3. Coherence:
Quantum coherence refers to the ability of a quantum system to maintain a defined phase relationship between different states. It's crucial for quantum phenomena like entanglement to occur and persist.

4. Electronic communications and entanglement:
Standard electronic communications (like radio waves, Wi-Fi, or cellular signals) do not directly create quantum entanglement. These classical forms of communication use electromagnetic waves that don't preserve quantum states in a way that would create entanglement.

However, there are some developing technologies and theoretical proposals that relate to your question:

a) Quantum networks: Researchers are working on creating quantum networks that can distribute entanglement over long distances using quantum repeaters and other specialized equipment. These aren't conventional electronic communications but rather quantum communication channels.

b) Entanglement swapping: This is a technique where entanglement can be extended to particles that have never interacted directly. It's a key concept in quantum repeaters and quantum teleportation.

c) Theoretical proposals: Some theoretical physicists have proposed ideas about how entanglement might be created or manipulated using electromagnetic fields, but these are largely speculative and not experimentally verified.

5. Conditions for entanglement:
Entanglement typically occurs under very controlled conditions, such as:
- When particles are created together (like in certain types of atomic decay)
- When particles interact at a quantum level (like in certain types of collisions)
- Through careful manipulation in quantum experiments (using lasers, ion traps, etc.)

The key requirements are usually:
- A system isolated from environmental decoherence
- Precise control over quantum states
- Mechanisms to create quantum superposition and interaction

In conclusion, while conventional electronic communications don't create entanglement, there are emerging quantum technologies that aim to use specialized equipment to create and distribute entanglement over distances. These technologies are still in development and are quite different from our everyday electronic communications.

The idea of creating entanglement through conventional electronic means is intriguing but not currently supported by our understanding of quantum mechanics. However, quantum science is a rapidly evolving field, and new discoveries could potentially change our understanding in the future.
