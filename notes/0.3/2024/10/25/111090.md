Create a logo inspired by M.C. Escher's drawing hands, rendered as a clean infinity symbol. Two pairs of stylized hands should meet at the center of the infinity loop, their fingers intertwining to create the crossing point. The hands should be bold and graphic, with clean lines suitable for reproduction at small sizes. Use pure black and white with crisp edges - no gradients or fine details that would be lost when reduced. The infinity loop should be formed by the negative space between the hands and the bold outer stroke. Think of the elegant simplicity of the Nike swoosh but with the philosophical depth of Escher's paradoxical drawings. The design should read clearly at 1-inch size while maintaining the profound symbolism of infinite mutual creation and support. Each hand should be simultaneously drawing and being drawn by the others, creating an eternal cycle of giving and receiving help.

I want a logo four a nonprofit organization called empowering change that gives people the information they need to live their best lives so then they can help others as well. And I love this preliminary logo of an infinity symbol with intertwined, hands that are meant to evoke mc. Esher's hands drawing each other, but this isn't getting it right? And so I'm trying to figure out what to do differently. Can you help me generate some variations on this that have a more compelling, yet still simple black and white graphic mc escher like logo but that doesn't look cheap. It looks like it has meaning and symbolism, and that actually is important

Here are some ideas on how to refine your logo design for the Empowering Change nonprofit:

**1. Enhance the Infinity Symbol:**

- **Clarity and Proportion:** Ensure the infinity symbol is clear and well-proportioned. The current design seems a bit cluttered.
- **Symbolism:** Consider incorporating elements into the infinity symbol that represent the core values of your organization. For example, a heart, a book, or a lightbulb.

**2. Refine the Hands:**

- **Clarity and Detail:** The hands should be clear and well-defined. Consider simplifying the details to avoid a cluttered look.
- **Connection:** The hands should be positioned in a way that emphasizes their connection and the cyclical nature of empowerment.

**3. Typography:**

- **Font Choice:** Choose a font that is clean, modern, and reflects the organization's mission. Consider a sans-serif font for readability.
- **Placement:** The font should be placed strategically to enhance the overall design.

**4. Color Palette:**

- **Black and White:** While black and white is a classic choice, consider adding a subtle color accent to draw attention to specific elements.

**Here are some specific examples of how to refine the logo:**

**Option 1: Minimalist Infinity Symbol with Hands**

- Simplify the hands to focus on the intertwining aspect.
- Use a bold, clean infinity symbol.
- Consider adding a subtle color accent to the infinity symbol.

**Option 2: Hands as the Infinity Symbol**

- Use the hands to form the infinity symbol.
- Simplify the hands to focus on the gesture of empowerment.
- Consider adding a subtle color accent to the hands.

**Option 3: Infinity Symbol with Symbolic Elements**

- Incorporate symbols like a heart, a book, or a lightbulb into the infinity symbol.
- Use a bold, clean infinity symbol.
- Consider adding a subtle color accent to the symbolic elements.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Seek Professional Help:** If you're unsure about the design process, consider hiring a professional graphic designer.
- **Get Feedback:** Share your design with others and gather feedback to refine your concept.
- **Test Different Variations:** Experiment with different layouts, colors, and fonts to find the best combination.

Remember, a good logo should be simple, memorable, and relevant to your organization's mission. By following these guidelines, you can create a compelling logo that represents the values of Empowering Change.

Can you generate some prompts that I can feed directly into an image generation?A I to get exactly what we want

![](https://www.gstatic.com/lamda/images/gemini_sparkle_v002_d4735304ff6292a690345.svg)

TIP: Ask Gemini to refine images

With image generation in Gemini, your imagination is the limit. If what you see doesn't quite match what you had in mind, try adding more details to the prompt. The more specific you are, the better Gemini can create images that reflect your vision.

Sure, here are some prompts that you can feed directly into an image generation AI to get exactly what you want:

Now let's try it again. This looks kinda creepy and almost like a Swastika. I don't like that. Think of the mcs, your drawing of two hands, drawing each other and extend that into a black and white, bold infinity symbol

Yes, 100%. Yes, now can we have the hands at the middle of that infinity symbol drawing each other as it would in an esher

Amazing Let's keep this in terms of graphic quality. There's this is almost perfect. I just want to try different variations with how the hands interact with each other in that infinity symbol to really emphasize that oroboric, quality of help and interdependence

I like that one slightly less than the one before that, so let's generate a few more variations

![](https://www.gstatic.com/lamda/images/gemini_sparkle_v002_d4735304ff6292a690345.svg)

I made a few changes to improve the image.

Let's go back to the original intent here and can we generate some more like the first ones

**Here are some more logo variations based on the concept of intertwined hands in an infinity symbol:**

**Option 1: Minimalist Infinity Symbol with Hands**

- Focuses on the intertwining aspect of the hands.
- Uses a bold, clean infinity symbol.
- Emphasizes the connection and cyclical nature of empowerment.

**Option 2: Hands as the Infinity Symbol**

- Uses the hands themselves to form the infinity symbol.
- Simplifies the hands to focus on the gesture of empowerment.
- Creates a strong visual metaphor for the cycle of giving and receiving.

**Option 3: Infinity Symbol with Symbolic Elements**

- Incorporates symbols like a heart, a book, or a lightbulb into the infinity symbol.
- Uses a bold, clean infinity symbol.
- Represents the core values of the organization within the design.

A minimalist black and white logo featuring two hands intertwined to form an infinity symbol. The design should be clean, elegant, and evoke a sense of interconnectedness and empowerment. The hands should be stylized and symbolic, rather than realistic. The infinity symbol should be the primary focus, with the hands serving as its defining feature.
