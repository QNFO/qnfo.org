Write a an essay. A draft essay titled Sodom is next to the courthouse blames much of modern American dysfunction, at least at the macro government level on the breakdown of the rule of law and its inability to apply in a way that both average citizens and the privileged class of elected officials and lawmakers. And then the sort of high priests of the judicial system and their minions, lawyers, which are entirely self-serving, make the case that this represents the equivalent of the Bible story of Sodom and gamora, when God sent angels to find just one righteous person in those places. And the angels could nod. In fact, the lower the residents tried to rape the angels before they departed and I find that strikingly similar to so many cases, 3I can think of in my own experience just in the past year where that’s exactly what I was done. What was done to me? I was raped. By lawyers, I trusted won one of whom was a pro Bono eviction attorney who said I was wasting her time and ultimately committed malpractice by failing to disclose a serious conflict of interest. Another was an employment attorney that I was so happy to find. After so many employment attorneys wouldn’t return my call when I was unlawfully terminated. Accept, I’d contacted an employment mill where I was just a file number and I haven’t heard from them in quite some time. After I call them on the carpet for misspelling my name a filing, and then just when I thought that the problem was that I wasn’t forking over my own money. And that I should just pay to play. I retain the lawyer to represent me in a civil matter and immediately regretted it once. I found out that their first step was 9 to petition the court. It was to have a kickoff meeting with me and to spend my money, my retainer, on Administrivia, and so I canceled immediately accept. They still build me $200. I canceled within 24 hours before every talking to anyone I still got billed $200. Thats rape, and that’s the problem with our society, at least in America today.

Here’s a draft essay based on your request:

Title: Sodom is Next to the Courthouse

In modern America, a growing dysfunction plagues our society, particularly at the macro-governmental level. This dysfunction can be largely attributed to the breakdown of the rule of law and its uneven application between average citizens and the privileged class of elected officials and lawmakers. At the heart of this issue lies a judicial system that has become self-serving, led by what can be described as “high priests” and their minions – lawyers.

This situation bears a striking resemblance to the biblical story of Sodom and Gomorrah. In that tale, God sent angels to find just one righteous person in those cities, but they found none. Instead, the residents attempted to rape the angels before they departed. This narrative parallels the experiences of many ordinary citizens who find themselves at the mercy of a corrupt legal system.

Personal experiences can illustrate this point. In the past year alone, I have encountered multiple instances where I felt metaphorically “raped” by the legal system and those who claim to uphold it. One such case involved a pro bono eviction attorney who not only dismissed my concerns but also committed malpractice by failing to disclose a serious conflict of interest. Another instance involved an employment attorney from a legal mill who treated me as nothing more than a file number, neglecting proper communication and even misspelling my name in official filings.

Even when attempting to pay for legal services, the experience was no better. Upon retaining a lawyer for a civil matter, I discovered that their primary concern was not petitioning the court but rather conducting a “kickoff meeting” and spending my retainer on administrative tasks. When I attempted to cancel the service within 24 hours, before even speaking with anyone, I was still billed $200. This feels like a form of financial rape, taking advantage of those seeking justice.

These experiences are not isolated incidents but symptoms of a larger problem in American society. The legal system, which should protect and serve the people, has become a tool for exploitation and self-enrichment. Like the residents of Sodom and Gomorrah, many in the legal profession seem to have lost their moral compass, prioritizing personal gain over justice and ethical conduct.

The breakdown of the rule of law and its unequal application has far-reaching consequences. It erodes public trust in institutions, creates a sense of helplessness among ordinary citizens, and perpetuates a cycle of injustice. When those tasked with upholding the law become its greatest abusers, society as a whole suffers.

To address this issue, we must demand greater accountability within the legal system. This includes stricter oversight of legal professionals, more transparent billing practices, and harsher penalties for those who abuse their positions of power. Additionally, efforts should be made to improve access to justice for all citizens, regardless of their financial means.

In conclusion, the current state of the American legal system bears an unsettling resemblance to the biblical cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. If we are to avoid a similar fate, we must work to restore integrity to our institutions and ensure that the rule of law applies equally to all, from the highest offices to the average citizen. Only then can we hope to build a society that truly upholds the principles of justice and equality upon which it was founded.

This is a good first draft, and I would like to augment it even more with more personal details. I want to talk about how, in my search for truth and questioning my own ignorance. I spoke with several attorneys in an attempt to socially understand what was going on here into Make my case to them that the things that have happened to me over the past year. These 3 cases, in particular work thrown at me and I felt that as a citizen, I should have more empowerment over the process, and the fact that my apartment eviction was decided not On any substantive meritorious claims of which I had several defending the unlawful detainer, not one but was considered by the court throughout that entire ordeal, including a petition by my negligent attorney, dismiss, how on earth can we say we have functioning anything? When the rule of law is in fact, procedural administrivia of the court and that it would be analogous to saying you’re guilty of murder if you didn’t file the forms on time, because that’s exactly what got me. Evicted, and albeit a civil case, I demanded a jury I wanted The substantive meritorious claims in defense heard and I was willing to be wrong as long as they could be decided on substance without even knowing without having any clue that that’s just not how America works and that’s not how our laws work and I won’t even blame San Francisco, because I don’t think. It’s limited to San Francisco I think that we’ve got an entire class privileged, even authoritarian elite end for those lawyers who can find work that includes them and even the ones that can’t must have been really well indoctrinated by the cult of their law school. Because I could not convince that maybe maybe their assistants could help me help others, not one including who had a daughter that I pled to him and tried to give evidence the incentives for pursuing this. We’re not actually mine, they were a greater good That I wanted to leave this world better than I entered it. And could he not help me not for my sake? But for his daughters and all I got back was a bunch of mumbo jumbo, Latin league leaves about procedure, so whether you believe in the Judeo Christian tradition or have read the Bible. I think it’s important to consider the parallels. Just 1 just 1 righteous person can save our civilization, and yet they crucified Christ. A long time ago.

Here’s an expanded version of the essay incorporating your additional details and personal experiences:

Title: Sodom is Next to the Courthouse

In modern America, a growing dysfunction plagues our society, particularly at the macro-governmental level. This dysfunction can be largely attributed to the breakdown of the rule of law and its uneven application between average citizens and the privileged class of elected officials and lawmakers. At the heart of this issue lies a judicial system that has become self-serving, led by what can be described as “high priests” and their minions – lawyers.

This situation bears a striking resemblance to the biblical story of Sodom and Gomorrah. In that tale, God sent angels to find just one righteous person in those cities, but they found none. Instead, the residents attempted to rape the angels before they departed. This narrative parallels the experiences of many ordinary citizens who find themselves at the mercy of a corrupt legal system.

My personal experiences over the past year illustrate this point vividly. In my search for truth and understanding, I encountered multiple instances where I felt metaphorically “raped” by the legal system and those who claim to uphold it. One particularly egregious case involved my apartment eviction, which was decided not on any substantive merits of my defense against the unlawful detainer, but on procedural technicalities. Not a single one of my legitimate claims was considered by the court throughout the entire ordeal, including a petition to dismiss filed by my negligent attorney.

This experience led me to question how we can claim to have a functioning legal system when the rule of law is reduced to mere procedural administrivia. It’s akin to declaring someone guilty of murder simply because they failed to file the correct forms on time. In my case, despite demanding a jury trial and wanting my substantive claims heard, I was evicted based on procedural grounds. This revelation shattered my naive belief in how America and its laws work.

In an attempt to understand and potentially change this system, I spoke with several attorneys, trying to make my case that citizens should have more empowerment over the legal process. I pleaded with them to consider the greater good, explaining that my motivation wasn’t just personal but aimed at leaving the world better than I found it. I even appealed to one lawyer’s paternal instincts, asking him to help not for my sake, but for his daughter’s future. Yet, all I received in response was legal jargon and procedural explanations, devoid of any real concern for justice or societal improvement.

This experience isn’t limited to San Francisco or any specific locality; it seems to be a systemic issue across America. We’ve cultivated a privileged, almost authoritarian elite class within the legal profession. Even those lawyers who can’t find work within this elite system appear to have been indoctrinated by the cult-like atmosphere of law schools, unable or unwilling to question the status quo or consider alternative perspectives.

The breakdown of the rule of law and its unequal application has far-reaching consequences. It erodes public trust in institutions, creates a sense of helplessness among ordinary citizens, and perpetuates a cycle of injustice. When those tasked with upholding the law become its greatest abusers, society as a whole suffers.

To address this issue, we must demand greater accountability within the legal system. This includes stricter oversight of legal professionals, more transparent billing practices, and harsher penalties for those who abuse their positions of power. Additionally, efforts should be made to improve access to justice for all citizens, regardless of their financial means.

The parallels to the biblical story of Sodom and Gomorrah are striking. Just as God sought one righteous person to save those cities, our society desperately needs individuals willing to stand up for true justice and equality under the law. Yet, much like how Christ was crucified long ago, those who challenge the system often face severe consequences.

How deeply troubling that the current state of the American legal system bears an unsettling resemblance to the biblical cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. If we are to avoid a similar fate, we must work to restore integrity to our institutions and ensure that the rule of law applies equally to all, from the highest offices to the average citizen. We need to foster a legal culture that prioritizes substantive justice over procedural technicalities and empowers citizens to actively participate in the legal process. Only then can we hope to build a society that truly upholds the principles of justice and equality upon which it was founded.
