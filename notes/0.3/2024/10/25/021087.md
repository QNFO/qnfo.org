What are some job titles for freelance project based consulting roles offered by a social good nonprofit to enterprising ideas that can be self-funded for a fixed implementation period or given key success, metrics and continued funding. I’m thinking something like initiative success lead or implementation success manager or something with the word consultant in it. Or look at it the other way that given the funding structure and timeline of such roles, they might be analogous to fellowships or similar types of research and academic roles which would be more in line with the elevated status. I’d like this role to have even if an independent contractor 1099 employee. The phrase independent contractor is also valid. But that gets a bad rap from uber and such, so I don’t want to mislead about what the role is, but also elevated in the way that account execs are now called customer success managers

Here are some potential job titles that combine the elements you’re looking for:

1. Social Impact Consultant
2. Innovation Fellow
3. Project Implementation Specialist
4. Initiative Success Lead
5. Social Enterprise Strategist
6. Impact Venture Consultant
7. Nonprofit Innovation Catalyst
8. Social Good Project Architect
9. Change Implementation Advisor
10. Social Impact Fellow
11. Venture Philanthropy Consultant
12. Nonprofit Transformation Specialist
13. Social Innovation Strategist
14. Impact Initiative Manager
15. Sustainability Project Lead
16. Social Good Implementation Expert
17. Nonprofit Venture Consultant
18. Community Impact Strategist
19. Social Enterprise Development Advisor
20. Changemaker-in-Residence

These titles aim to convey the project-based nature of the role, the focus on social good and innovation, and the elevated status you’re seeking. They also avoid potentially misleading terms like “independent contractor” while still implying a degree of autonomy and expertise

The last one changemaker in residence is spot on because it indicates exactly what I want out of those roles, they’re not about the rolls, getting in a cushy job that just reports to work, they’re actually about affecting change, and the success of those roles spend entirely on their ability to follow through on whatever they propose for an initiative.

I’m glad you found “Changemaker-in-Residence” particularly fitting! It does indeed capture the essence of what you’re looking for - a role focused on driving real change rather than just filling a position. This title emphasizes the proactive, innovative nature of the work and the responsibility for seeing initiatives through to successful implementation.

Building on this concept, here are a few more titles that might resonate with your vision:

1. Impact Innovator-in-Residence
2. Social Transformation Architect
3. Initiative Impact Lead
4. Change Implementation Catalyst
5. Social Innovation Fellow
6. Impact Project Orchestrator
7. Nonprofit Venture Accelerator
8. Social Good Transformation Specialist
9. Community Impact Innovator
10. Social Change Implementation Expert

These titles further emphasize the action-oriented, results-driven nature of the role, while also highlighting the innovative and transformative aspects of the work. They convey a sense of leadership and responsibility for driving meaningful change, which aligns well with your vision for these project-based consulting roles in the social good sector.

I still prefer changemaker in residence

I understand your preference for “Changemaker-in-Residence.” It’s an excellent choice that encapsulates the essence of the role you’re describing. This title effectively communicates:

1. The focus on creating tangible change
2. The temporary yet impactful nature of the position (implied by “in-residence”)
3. A sense of prestige and expertise
4. The action-oriented approach to solving social issues
5. The innovative and entrepreneurial spirit of the role

“Changemaker-in-Residence” strikes a good balance between sounding professional and conveying the unique, dynamic nature of the position. It avoids corporate jargon while still sounding elevated and important.

If you decide to use this title, it could be effective to provide a brief description or tagline to further clarify the role’s responsibilities and goals. This could help potential candidates and partners quickly understand the nature and scope of the position.

Write this job description

In the last paragraph, about diversity inclusion beefed that up with specific nouns emphasizing that we welcome those of minority historically, disadvantaged and oppressed groups for the powerful story that they can bring to change making, such as women, people of color.

4. The commitment to diversity and inclusion is strongly emphasized.

Areas for Improvement:

1. Clarity on Funding: While the position mentions being “self-funded” initially, it’s unclear what this means. More specifics on funding expectations would be helpful.
2. Project Scope: The description could benefit from examples of potential projects or areas of focus to give candidates a clearer idea of what they might work on.
3. Success Metrics: While the importance of measurable outcomes is mentioned, providing some examples of what these might look like could be beneficial.
4. Time Commitment: The duration is left open-ended. Even if flexible, providing a range (e.g., 6-18 months) could help set expectations.
5. Support Structure: More details on the day-to-day support and resources available to the Changemaker would be helpful.
6. Application Process: Information on how to apply and what the selection process looks like is missing.
7. Compensation: While it may be quantitative into the qualitative and vice versa, and I’ll be the first to say, it is not acceptable to simply translate lives into dollars and vice versa, but obviously economic value is some part of this, and so that’s the key and honestly part of this may actually be designing innovative new Evaluation methods that recognize that life isn’t just a cost-benefit analysis.project-dependent, some indication of potential compensation or stipend would be useful for candidates.

Balancing Blue Sky Thinking and Practical Details:

To strike a balance, consider:

1. Providing a few concrete examples of past or potential projects alongside the more aspirational language.
2. Outlining a basic framework for how projects are developed and implemented, while emphasizing flexibility and innovation.
3. Including a brief section on “A Day in the Life” of a Changemaker-in-Residence to give a more tangible sense of the role.
4. Offering a clearer picture of the support structure and resources available, while still emphasizing the need for self-motivation and independence.
5. Maintaining the inspirational language but grounding it with more specific expectations and milestones.

By incorporating these elements, the job description can maintain its visionary appeal while providing the necessary practical details to attract and prepare suitable candidates for the role.

Addressing the comments as follows, one for funding. Basically, what it’s saying is, if you have a good idea pitch it and you can start
With our seed funding that I’m actually going to cell fund myself as the founder and executive director but then there’s an expectation that Part of this is getting grant money in and finding the an external funding source so being sort of a self-contained little entrepreneurial business, to figure out how to get grant money in, but that shouldn’t stop you from feeling a part of the organization why you do that and That will be specified by the contractor the terms of the initiation and likewise the other terms like period of performance. And any, let’s say, in the case, there might be Fringe. Benefits like travel is required or whatever? That’s all going to be in there, so it really depends. And especially since I wanna go after international organizations and not just make this a us focused effort, I have no clue what to expect in other countries so I want to keep that relatively vague, but also say, Hey, this isn’t like any other contract position? We know we’re all doing this for our mutual benefit, not so somebody can get rich off your labor.

For project scope, consider this like shark tank. What’s your pitch? Maybe it’s to pilot something in a small-scale, and we can just sell fund it and do it in-house. That’s fine, or maybe there’s something that has a big hairy audacious goal, and we need to figure out funding and so forth. And wait for that before we can implement it like AI 411, you know, that has both a micro and the macro component. That’s probably a good example. We can pile it sort of the tech stack without worrying about widespread deployment.

Success metrics, R critical and very, very initiative. Specific, you know, there are some general things like we talk about increased quality of life, but ultimately, this is the challenge of translating the quantitative into the qualitative and vice versa, and I’ll be the first to say, it is not acceptable to simply translate lives into dollars and vice versa, but obviously economic value is some part of this, and so that’s the key and honestly part of this may actually be designing innovative new Evaluation methods that recognize that life isn’t just a cost benefit analysis

For timelines, I think it’s important to recognize that these things. Do you take time to come to fruition? But then a phased approach necessarily keeps things moving and prevents stagnation and last minute surprises, so something that has achievable milestones in the months, not years. Is what we’re looking for here? Because ultimately, if something’s not working, we need to fail fast to preserve the organization’s limited funding for seed rounds.Before external funding comes in right now, we don’t have any external funding

The support structure is I’m Rowan, and I’m still funding the organization. I founded 2 help others by also helping change myself, and I believe in you. The change maker and resident and I’ll do whatever I can with my network and resources to support you, and we’re both going to learn something so let’s keep that in mind that’s an important part of this, and that’s not just Bs To juice profits, we’re both going to learn something. Cause we’re not doing this for money.We’re doing it for passion and love

Thank you for providing these detailed clarifications. Based on your input, I’ll revise the job description to better reflect these points. Here’s an updated version:

Job Title: Changemaker-in-Residence

Organization: Empowering Change

Position Type: Social Good Implementation Lead

Empowering Change started with a mission to educate and inform our own individual growth to empower us to live our best lives today. Empowering our thoughts to change minds manifests change from information into the physical reality in which we coexist as humans. Turning innovative ideas into tangible social impact is the alchemy of changemaking, and we want to incubate social good that dignifies every human’s right to exist within a collective of others along our respective individual journeys. We acknowledge an assumed premise of “help” and limitations of one-size-fits-all social programs while respecting our autonomy of thought and authority of first-person lived experience. The Changemaker-in-Residence program seeks to both incubate measurable change and syndicate the very best strategies accessible for the greatest possible benefit.

Position Overview:
The Changemaker-in-Residence is a hands-on, results-driven role for individuals passionate about translating ideas into action. This position goes beyond conceptualization – it’s about rolling up your sleeves and implementing solutions that create measurable positive impact in the real world.

Key Responsibilities:
1. Transform innovative social impact ideas into real results
2. Implement one or more initiatives, managing all aspects from funding initiation to planning to stakeholder management, resource allocation, on-the-ground execution, and after-action evaluation and awareness promotion
3. Develop and track key performance indicators to measure real-world impact
4. Adapt strategies in real-time based on on-the-ground realities and feedback
5. Collaborate with community stakeholders to ensure initiatives meet actual needs
6. Document practical learnings, challenges, and successes throughout the implementation process
7. Demonstrate tangible, measurable outcomes of your work

What We’re Looking For:
- Passion for creating positive social change and empowering others
- Strong entrepreneurial spirit and ability to take initiative
- Skill in quickly mobilizing resources and forming networks, especially for securing grant funding
- Adaptability and comfort with being a jack-of-all-trades who can wear multiple hats
- Innovative thinking coupled with practical problem-solving skills
- Resilience and ability to own both successes and failures, learning from both
- Strong drive to turn ideas into action and see projects through to completion
- Intrinsic motivation to explore personal boundaries and push beyond comfort for the greater good.
- Ability to work effectively in unfamiliar and uncomfortable community settings as an outsider.
- Excellent project management skills in fast-paced, often ambiguous environments
- Strong communication and interpersonal skills to engage with various stakeholders
- Commitment to designing defensible evaluation metrics and collecting unbiased data
- Willingness to take calculated risks and pivot strategies when necessary
- Self-motivation and ability to work independently while also collaborating effectively
- Capacity to celebrate failures as learning opportunities and approach challenges with renewed purpose

Note: This role requires a unique blend of skills and attitudes. We’re looking for individuals who can independently drive projects from conception to completion, adapt to changing circumstances, and maintain a positive, purpose-driven outlook even in the face of setbacks. Your ability to innovate, network, and persevere is just as important as your specific skills or experience.

Unique Program Structure:
Our Changemaker-in-Residence program offers a hybrid model that combines elements of fiscal sponsorship and startup incubation:

1. Fiscal Sponsorship: Empowering Change can expedite your project under our US Internal Revenue Service 501(c)(3) status for receiving grant funding.
2. Startup Support: We provide resources typically associated with startup incubators, including mentorship, networking opportunities, and potential access to seed funding.
3. Flexible Duration: The length of your residency is tied to your project’s needs and success, rather than a predetermined timeframe.
4. Results-Oriented Approach: Continued support is linked to achieving key success metrics and demonstrating impact.
5. Potential for Spin-Off: Successful projects may have the opportunity to spin off into independent social enterprises or nonprofits.

This structure allows you to focus on creating meaningful change with the stability of an established nonprofit and the innovative spirit of a startup.

Term and Funding:
This is a [duration] position with the possibility of extension based on project success and funding availability. The role is self-funded for the initial implementation period, with potential for continued funding upon achieving key success metrics.

Empowering Change exists to elevate the gifts of diversity inclusive of our full authentic selves. We strongly encourage and welcome applications from individuals of all backgrounds, particularly those from historically disadvantaged and oppressed groups. We recognize the powerful stories and unique insights that these individuals bring to changemaking. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Citizens of the world residing outside the United States
- Women and individuals of all gender identities
- People of color
- Indigenous peoples and those displaced from their native lands
- LGBTQIA+ individuals, including those who are transgender, non-binary, genderqueer, and gender non-conforming
