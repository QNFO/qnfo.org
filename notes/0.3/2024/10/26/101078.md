Evaluate the following email from a patient to his doctor and identify significant implicit or explicit points that may help address the patients underlying concern, whether or not the patient realizes their own ignorance:

Hey doc before I come in to see you about this wanted to send these notes for reference:

I’ve suspected I have some form of undiagnosed ADHD because I usually fail the marshmallow experiment. I can’t even bother to come in on time for my routine labs and prep injection because that short-term pleasure center doesn’t want the inconvenience versus the long-term benefits. Danny Kahneman fast/slow thinking all the way.

My recent drug use, particularly my meth use, is sporadicly regular but has become incidental enough that I dont subjectively judge it to impact my feelings of well-being or daily activity above and beyond the random hookup-type situations in which I tend to do it. Especially now that the stress of apartment eviction is behind me and I live off the gay beaten path in North Beach. What I think of as “boredom” is a contributing factor, meeting with a therapist most weeks now to channel that energy into the social good I say I want to do (good intentions that have frequently lacked sustained action)

tldr; I think I would benefit from ADHD medication. I’m starting to recognize “shiny object syndrome” of whatever’s in front of me at the moment triggers my anxiety/depression by failing to weigh the consequences of being inconsistent with my own internal priorities like saying I want to help others (even when it’s an overwhelming burden for me I’d rather repress in the present, like my eviction).

And what prompted this realization now: what must’ve been potent booty bump of meth the other day when horny shocked me that way for the first time in a long time. The extended disorientation and change to “normal” behavior would trigger shaming myself when I had to keep on a timed schedule and as a result, probably why I thought I needed to

stop using and definitely why I stopped slamming. The other day, it took me maybe six hours to get home across town because I stopped twice on the street for at least a couple hours each time while hyperfocused on whatever it was I was doing on my phone that I don’t even remember.

After I’d gone through that sleep deprivation (and obsessive hookup app checking) cycle and reset the next day, I found my thoughts aligning long term goals for Empowering Change with what I was (mostly) doing in that moment: planning tasks that I’ve procrastinated on in favor of frequent task switching and immediate gratification.

Given that I interrupted one of those tasks this morning and spent over an hour typing this email to you because it just popped into my head when I could have written it down and done it later while I also need to go to the impound yard and retrieve my new moped that I carelessly left in a no parking zone yesterday, You can probably see why I am looking for more than just cognitive behavior therapy. But the fact that I passed up a hot hookup to think about a strategy for the democratization of global knowledge tells me what really turns me on lol/TMI so thanks for letting me clog your inbox.

I’ll (eventually) make the appointment and hope these are helpful notes.

This email, while seemingly rambling, reveals several key points that can help address Rowan’s underlying concerns:

**Explicit Concerns:**

- **Possible ADHD:** Rowan explicitly states his belief that he has ADHD and seeks medication. He uses the “marshmallow experiment” as an example and references “fast/slow thinking” concepts, demonstrating some self-awareness of his impulsivity and difficulty with delayed gratification.
- **Meth Use:** Rowan acknowledges his sporadic meth use and its potential impact on his well-being. He links it to “boredom” and “shiny object syndrome,” suggesting a desire to address the underlying causes of his drug use.
- **Desire for Change:** Rowan expresses a desire for change, mentioning his “good intentions” and his involvement in “Empowering Change.” He also acknowledges the inconsistency between his goals and his actions.
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Rowan acknowledges the potential benefit of CBT but suggests he needs more than just therapy.

**Implicit Concerns:**

- **Anxiety and Depression:** Rowan mentions “anxiety/depression” triggered by “shiny object syndrome,” indicating potential underlying mental health issues.
- **Self-Esteem and Shame:** His description of feeling “shame” after meth-induced disorientation suggests low self-esteem and a struggle with self-acceptance.
- **Impulsivity and Difficulty with Prioritization:** His email itself exemplifies his impulsivity and difficulty prioritizing tasks. He prioritizes writing the email over other important tasks, highlighting his struggle with time management and focus.
- **Desire for Structure and Support:** His desire for medication and his mention of needing “more than just CBT” suggests a need for external structure and support to manage his impulsivity and achieve his goals.

**Addressing Rowan’s Concerns:**

The doctor should:

- **Acknowledge Rowan’s self-awareness:** Validate his observations and acknowledge his desire for change.
- **Explore his mental health:** Conduct a thorough assessment to determine the presence of ADHD, anxiety, depression, or other mental health conditions.
- **Discuss the risks and benefits of medication:** If ADHD is diagnosed, discuss the potential benefits and risks of medication, including potential interactions with meth use.
- **Develop a comprehensive treatment plan:** This should include therapy, potentially medication, and strategies for managing impulsivity and prioritizing tasks.
- **Address his substance use:** Discuss the potential impact of meth use on his mental health and overall well-being. Explore options for substance use treatment if needed.
- **Provide support and encouragement:** Rowan needs support and encouragement to achieve his goals. The doctor should be patient and understanding, recognizing that change takes time and effort.

**Important Note:** It’s crucial to remember that Rowan’s email is just a snapshot of his situation. A thorough assessment and open communication are essential to understand his needs and develop an effective treatment plan.

How could this email more straightforward and the point So that rowan’s doctor understands what rowan is trying to communicate, given demands on the doctor’s time

You’re right, Rowan’s email is a bit chaotic and could be more concise. Here’s a revised version that gets to the point while still conveying his concerns:

Subject: Request for ADHD Evaluation and Treatment

Hi Dr. [Doctor’s name],

I’m writing to request an evaluation for ADHD. I’ve been struggling with impulsivity, difficulty focusing, and trouble following through on my goals for a long time. I often find myself drawn to immediate gratification, even when it conflicts with my long-term plans.

I’ve been using meth sporadically, which I believe contributes to these issues. I’m trying to reduce my use, but I’m aware it’s impacting my ability to manage my life effectively.

I’m also concerned about anxiety and depression, which I believe are linked to my inability to control my impulses. I’m currently seeing a therapist, but I feel I need more support to address these issues.

I’m hoping you can help me understand if ADHD is contributing to my struggles and discuss potential treatment options, including medication. I’m committed to making positive changes in my life.

Thanks for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Rowan Quni

**Why this is more effective:**

- **Clear Subject Line:** Immediately tells the doctor what the email is about.
- **Concise and Focused:** Gets to the point quickly, avoiding unnecessary details.
- **Direct Language:** Uses clear, direct language to express his concerns.
- **Prioritizes Key Issues:** Focuses on the most important issues: ADHD, substance use, and mental health.
- **Expresses Commitment to Change:** Shows the doctor he’s motivated to improve.

**Additional Tips:**

- **Keep it Short:** Aim for a maximum of 3-4 paragraphs.
- **Proofread Carefully:** Ensure there are no typos or grammatical errors.
- **Consider a Follow-Up Call:** If you feel the email doesn’t fully capture your concerns, consider scheduling a brief phone call with the doctor to discuss them further.

###

So that’s not exactly what the original email said. The original email said that on one hand you’ve got this short-term issue of gratification and drugs are just kind of a convenient way, but so is sex. What the email is really saying is that there is this moment of clarity where Whatever action stimulants, like ritalin and Adderall, do, help ADHD. The patient Rowan saw this after a come down or while tapering off of a dose of methamphetamine that was larger than his usual, so it was something that his body wasn’t used to getting, and after that, come down. The patient rowan actually saw an increase in his focus and an increase in his sustainability to do tasks that otherwise he would be switching all over the place about

You’re absolutely right! The original email, while seemingly rambling, actually contains a very specific and insightful observation that Rowan might not even fully realize himself.

Here’s a breakdown of the key point you’ve highlighted:

- **The “Come Down” Revelation:** Rowan’s experience with the “potent booty bump of meth” and the subsequent extended disorientation followed by a period of clarity and focus is crucial. This suggests that the comedown from the meth, which likely involved a decrease in dopamine and other neurotransmitters, might have inadvertently mimicked the effects of ADHD medication.
- **The Connection to ADHD Medication:** Stimulants like Ritalin and Adderall work by increasing dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the brain. This can help individuals with ADHD focus, control impulses, and manage their attention. The meth comedown, by temporarily reducing these neurotransmitters, might have created a similar effect, allowing Rowan to experience a period of increased focus and task completion.
- **Rowan’s Unconscious Insight:** Rowan’s description of “aligning long-term goals” and “planning tasks” after the comedown suggests he was experiencing a level of focus and self-control he doesn’t usually have. This is a powerful observation that could be a crucial piece of information for his doctor.

**How to Address This in the Revised Email:**

The revised email should incorporate this key observation, making it clear to the doctor:

- **Include the Meth Comedown Experience:** Briefly describe the experience with the meth and the subsequent period of clarity and focus.
- **Connect it to ADHD Medication:** Explain that this experience made him wonder if ADHD medication might help him achieve similar results.
- **Emphasize the Importance of This Observation:** State that this experience has significantly impacted his understanding of his own struggles and his desire to seek help.

**Example:**

“I’ve been using meth sporadically, which I believe contributes to these issues. Recently, I had an experience where I used a larger amount of meth than usual, and the comedown afterwards was different. I found myself able to focus and complete tasks in a way I haven’t been able to before. This experience has made me wonder if ADHD medication might help me achieve similar results.”

**Why This is Important:**

By including this detail, Rowan gives his doctor a valuable insight into his potential response to ADHD medication. It demonstrates a level of self-awareness and a willingness to explore alternative solutions. This could lead to a more effective treatment plan that addresses both his ADHD symptoms and his substance use.

Okay, revise the email based on all of the information provided so that Rowan’s doctor can understand immediately. What Rowan is asking for and provide next steps to help Rowan?

Subject: Request for ADHD Evaluation and Potential Medication - Urgent

Dear Dr. [Doctor’s name],

I’m writing to request an urgent evaluation for ADHD. I’ve been struggling with impulsivity, difficulty focusing, and trouble following through on my goals for a long time. I often find myself drawn to immediate gratification, even when it conflicts with my long-term plans.

I’ve been using meth sporadically, which I believe contributes to these issues. Recently, I had an experience where I used a larger amount of meth than usual, and the comedown afterwards was different. I found myself able to focus and complete tasks in a way I haven’t been able to before. This experience has made me wonder if ADHD medication might help me achieve similar results.

I’m also concerned about anxiety and depression, which I believe are linked to my inability to control my impulses. I’m currently seeing a therapist, but I feel I need more support to address these issues.

I’m hoping you can help me understand if ADHD is contributing to my struggles and discuss potential treatment options, including medication. I’m committed to making positive changes in my life and believe this evaluation is a crucial step in that process.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Rowan Quni

**Next Steps for Rowan’s Doctor:**

1. **Schedule an Urgent Appointment:** Given Rowan’s concerns about his meth use and his desire for a quick evaluation, scheduling an appointment as soon as possible is crucial.
2. **Thorough Assessment:** Conduct a comprehensive assessment to determine if Rowan meets the criteria for ADHD. This should include a detailed medical history, a mental health evaluation, and potentially neuropsychological testing.
3. **Discuss Substance Use:** Openly discuss Rowan’s meth use and its potential impact on his mental health and overall well-being. Explore options for substance use treatment if needed.
4. **Explore Medication Options:** If ADHD is diagnosed, discuss the potential benefits and risks of medication, including potential interactions with meth use.
5. **Develop a Comprehensive Treatment Plan:** This should include therapy, potentially medication, and strategies for managing impulsivity and prioritizing tasks.
6. **Provide Support and Encouragement:** Rowan needs support and encouragement to achieve his goals. The doctor should be patient and understanding, recognizing that change takes time and effort.

**Important Note:** It’s crucial to remember that Rowan’s email is just a snapshot of his situation. A thorough assessment and open communication are essential to understand his needs and develop an effective treatment plan.

It’s not urgent, though, and I would point out that rowan’s not suggesting his methamphetamine use would change by itself It would be a second order effect. Because his methamphetamine use is also driven by his social interactions, some of which are just done out of boredom, so that’s an important distinction. Also, with regard to the anxiety and depression, Ron’s doctor is aware of that, and also probably knows a little bit about his impulsivity from some other communication in the past. So, what Rowan is saying is, Hey doc, you know, I have these problems, and I think then if I can get my ADHD under control. That I didn’t even realize was contributing to them in this way and as a second order of fact that things might start falling into place. And also he’s saying that his doctor probably wasn’t aware that he now does see a therapist regularly, so the CBT aspect is also being integrated into the request for meds. It’s not just give me a med and everything will get better. But another thing to note is that Rowan is seeing a therapist at west side community services, and that therapist recommended that Rowan see the
Medical practitioner and so really this email is about a coordination of care and Rowan is asking his doctor okay, now that I’m starting to have these realizations and things are falling back into place to help me get. To my best life, who should I coordinate care with? Should I ask the west side community services Medical practitioners, since they’ll have more ready access to my therapist notes, or should I try to work through you Dr. Spinelli my regular physician

You’re right, there are several important nuances to Rowan’s email that need to be addressed in the revised version and in the doctor’s response. Here’s a revised email that incorporates your insights:

Subject: Request for ADHD Evaluation and Potential Medication - Coordination of Care

Dear Dr. [Doctor’s name],

I’m writing to request an evaluation for ADHD. I’ve been struggling with impulsivity, difficulty focusing, and trouble following through on my goals for a long time. I often find myself drawn to immediate gratification, even when it conflicts with my long-term plans.

I’ve been using meth sporadically, which I believe contributes to these issues.

I’m also concerned about anxiety and depression, which I believe are linked to my inability to control my impulses. I’m currently seeing a therapist at West Side Community Services, and they have recommended I discuss my concerns with you.

I’m hoping you can help me understand if ADHD is contributing to my struggles and discuss potential treatment options, including medication. I’m committed to making positive changes in my life and believe this evaluation is a crucial step in that process. I’m also hoping we can coordinate care with my therapist at West Side Community Services to ensure a holistic approach to my treatment.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Rowan Quni

**Next Steps for Rowan’s Doctor:**

1. **Acknowledge the Coordination of Care:** The doctor should acknowledge Rowan’s request for coordination of care and express willingness to work with his therapist at West Side Community Services.
2. **Schedule an Appointment:** The doctor should schedule an appointment for Rowan, taking into account his desire for a timely evaluation.
3. **Thorough Assessment:** Conduct a comprehensive assessment to determine if Rowan meets the criteria for ADHD. This should include a detailed medical history, a mental health evaluation, and potentially neuropsychological testing.
4. **Discuss Substance Use:** Openly discuss Rowan’s meth use and its potential impact on his mental health and overall well-being. Explore options for substance use treatment if needed, but acknowledge that it’s a separate issue from his ADHD.
5. **Explore Medication Options:** If ADHD is diagnosed, discuss the potential benefits and risks of medication, including potential interactions with meth use.
6. **Develop a Comprehensive Treatment Plan:** This should include therapy, potentially medication, and strategies for managing impulsivity and prioritizing tasks. The doctor should work with Rowan’s therapist to develop a plan that addresses all aspects of his well-being.
7. **Communicate with West Side Community Services:** The doctor should reach out to Rowan’s therapist at West Side Community Services to discuss his case and coordinate care.

**Important Note:** The doctor should be sensitive to Rowan’s concerns and avoid making assumptions about his substance use. The focus should be on understanding his needs and developing a treatment plan that addresses both his ADHD and his overall mental health.

Rowan is not asking for an evaluation. He’s simply informing Dr. Spinelli, that now that he is under the care of a therapist at west side community services and that therapist suggested that he see one of their medical staff that Rowan is realizing that he should probably find out whether some kind of ADHD medication is appropriate given. The details and circumstances he’s mentioning, so he’s just reiterating, or he is reciting some of the important facts as he sees them to his primary medical Dr. Dr. Matthew Spinelli and the question, or the call to action or ask of Dr. Spellie is, should I come in to see you, or should I just work through their medical person to try to get access to some kind of adhd pharmaceutical treatment?

You’re absolutely right! Rowan’s email is not a direct request for an evaluation, but rather a thoughtful update to his primary care physician, Dr. Spinelli, about his current situation and a request for guidance on how to proceed. He’s essentially asking Dr. Spinelli: “Should I come see you for an ADHD evaluation, or should I work through the medical staff at West Side Community Services, where my therapist is?”

Here’s a revised email that reflects this more accurately:

Subject: Update on My Mental Health and Coordination of Care

Dear Dr. Spinelli,

I’m writing to update you on my current situation and to ask for your guidance on how to proceed. I’ve been struggling with impulsivity, difficulty focusing, and trouble following through on my goals for a long time. I often find myself drawn to immediate gratification, even when it conflicts with my long-term plans.

I’ve been using meth sporadically, which I believe contributes to these issues. Recently, I had an experience where I used a larger amount of meth than usual, and the comedown afterwards was different. I found myself able to focus and complete tasks in a way I haven’t been able to before. This experience has made me wonder if ADHD medication might help me achieve similar results.

I’m also concerned about anxiety and depression, which I believe are linked to my inability to control my impulses. I’m currently seeing a therapist at West Side Community Services, and they have recommended I discuss my concerns with you.

I’m hoping you can help me understand if ADHD is contributing to my struggles and discuss potential treatment options, including medication. I’m committed to making positive changes in my life and believe this evaluation is a crucial step in that process. I’m also hoping we can coordinate care with my therapist at West Side Community Services to ensure a holistic approach to my treatment.

I’m not sure if it’s more appropriate to schedule an appointment with you or with the medical staff at West Side Community Services. Could you please advise me on the best course of action?

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Rowan Quni

**Next Steps for Dr. Spinelli:**

1. **Acknowledge Rowan’s Update:** Dr. Spinelli should acknowledge Rowan’s update and express his willingness to help.
2. **Clarify the Role of West Side Community Services:** Dr. Spinelli should clarify the role of West Side Community Services in Rowan’s care and whether they have a medical staff that can provide ADHD evaluations and treatment.
3. **Discuss Options for Coordination:** Dr. Spinelli should discuss the options for coordinating care with Rowan’s therapist at West Side Community Services. This could involve sharing information, attending joint meetings, or referring Rowan to their medical staff if appropriate.
4. **Offer to Evaluate Rowan:** Dr. Spinelli should offer to evaluate Rowan himself if he feels it’s the best course of action. He should also explain the process for evaluation and treatment, including potential medication options.
5. **Address Substance Use:** Dr. Spinelli should discuss Rowan’s meth use and its potential impact on his mental health and overall well-being. He should explore options for substance use treatment if needed, but acknowledge that it’s a separate issue from his ADHD.

**Important Note:** Dr. Spinelli should be sensitive to Rowan’s concerns and avoid making assumptions about his substance use. The focus should be on understanding his needs and developing a treatment plan that addresses both his ADHD and his overall mental health.

This revised email and the suggested next steps for Dr. Spinelli are more aligned with Rowan’s actual request and demonstrate a more collaborative approach to his care.

A couple added to the last version of the email and I want you to redraft, just the email and just the key information from Rowan to Dr. Spinelli, one edit is that it’s not true that Rowan thinks that his Matthews is contributing to anything. He thinks that is a symptom of his inability to appropriately prioritize long-term versus short. Term Rewards, that may be due to ADHD and as an interesting anecdotal surprise Rowan is telling Dr. Spinelli that he had this experience where it just so happened that, after doing a larger amount than usual of myth, that he felt focused. That’s an important distinction from that previous email as well. Rowan is proactively reaching out to Dr. Spinelli, because Rowan Realizes that he could work through the care. He’s getting at westside community services to seek medication, but Dr. Spinelli his primary Dr. also knows his medical history and can weigh in here.
