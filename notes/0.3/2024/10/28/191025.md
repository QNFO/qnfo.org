A key part of the story is I saw the sign and instinctively responded by going to the ATM. And getting out of 20, which was a recognition of my privilege and relative prosperity, it was not until I got up closer and handed him the bill that I saw the crucifix and felt such sense of wonder and awe. So let’s not overdramatize the story. Let’s focus on that very act and the mystery surrounding it, because as since I scurried off, I had no chance to talk to him or ask questions and that’s the mystery of our existence and what makes it so wonderful, we intuitively respond and Perhaps by the guiding hand of the universe, these things happen, I certainly had no control over those actions that day.

The Chicago heat was the kind that seeps into your bones, turns your thoughts sluggish. I was downtown, letting my feet decide my direction, which is how I often process things. Walking, thinking, existing. That day, though, the universe decided to interrupt my regularly scheduled programming.

Now, me and the universe? We have a complicated relationship. Ex-Catholic, current agnostic – let’s just say I haven’t darkened a church door with any real intention in a while. But there’s a whisper of something in me, maybe leftover from childhood, that can’t quite shake the possibility of… something more.

So I’m walking, lost in thought, when I see him. He wasn’t begging, not exactly. Just a quiet presence with a cardboard sign: “$15 gets me a room for the night.” Simple, direct, and it stopped me dead in my tracks.

I don’t know why this time was different. Maybe it was the way the heat seemed to shimmer around him. Or maybe it was the way I saw the sign, and without even thinking, I turned and headed for the ATM on the corner. Pulled out a twenty. Didn’t even hesitate.

It was only when I got closer, the twenty already in my hand, that I saw the crucifix. A plain gold cross against his shirt, catching the light. And in that moment, as I pressed the bill into his hand, our fingers brushed.

That’s when it hit me. A wave of… I don’t even know. Awe. Connection. Like something vast and unknowable had just passed through me.

Tears welled up, totally unexpected. I mumbled something stupid, probably “God bless” out of sheer reflex, and practically ran.

I’ve replayed that moment a thousand times. The way my feet just moved toward the ATM, the feeling of his hand, the sudden rush of tears. It was like my body knew what to do before my mind even caught up.

Maybe it was the universe, nudging me in the ribs. Maybe it was just a random act of kindness on a sweltering day. Whatever it was, it cracked something open inside me. A reminder that there are forces at work beyond our understanding, and sometimes, the most profound experiences come when we least expect them.

I still don’t know what to believe. But that day, on that street corner, I felt something real. And maybe, just maybe, that’s enough.

This is still too dramatic. I speak of the incident occurring in the summer of 2023 in downtown Chicago. Merely for reference to verify that this was the truth and that I bore witness to it. There’s no need to embellish. The Chicago heat for the most part, Chicago summers are quite lovely. And so let’s focus on the real crux of the story, literally

Okay, I understand. You want to focus on the core experience and the mystery surrounding your instinctive actions, removing any dramatic embellishments. Here’s a revised version that emphasizes those elements:

It was the summer of 2023, a typical Chicago day in the Loop. I was walking, letting my feet guide me, as I often do. I’m agnostic, haven’t been to church in years, but a sliver of my upbringing still whispers about something more.

That’s when I saw him. He stood quietly, holding a cardboard sign: “$15 gets me a room for the night.” No pleas, just a simple statement. And for some reason, it resonated.

Without a thought, I turned and walked directly to the corner ATM. I withdrew a twenty-dollar bill, not questioning the impulse.

As I approached him, twenty in hand, I noticed the crucifix. A plain gold cross against his shirt, catching the sunlight. Our fingers brushed as I pressed the bill into his hand.

And then it hit me. A wave of… something. Awe? Connection? Tears welled up, completely unexpected. I mumbled “God bless” purely out of reflex and practically ran.

I’ve replayed that moment countless times. The way my body seemed to act independently, the feeling of his hand, the sudden rush of emotion. It was as if I was being guided by something outside myself.

Was it the universe nudging me? A random act of kindness? I don’t have an answer. But that day, on that street corner, I experienced something profound and inexplicable. It was a stark reminder that there are forces beyond our comprehension, and sometimes, the most powerful moments are the ones we least anticipate.

The experience left me with more questions than answers, but maybe that’s okay. Maybe the mystery is part of it.

This version focuses on the immediacy of your experience, the lack of conscious thought, and the lingering mystery. It avoids dramatic language and lets the event speak for itself.

No I did not mumble. God bless it was silent again. Let’s not overdramatize the stor

Okay, I understand. You want to keep the language and tone very matter-of-fact, focusing solely on the actions and the feeling of being guided without explicitly stating it.

Here’s another revision with those adjustments:

Summer 2023, downtown Chicago. I was walking around the Loop, letting my feet decide my direction. I saw a man standing quietly. He held a cardboard sign: “$15 gets me a room for the night.”

I turned and walked to the ATM on the corner. I withdrew a twenty-dollar bill.

As I approached him, I saw the crucifix on his shirt, a plain gold cross. I pressed the bill into his hand. Our fingers brushed.

I felt a wave of… something. Tears welled in my eyes. I turned and walked away.

The entire sequence felt instinctive, as if my body moved before my mind could catch up. The feeling has stayed with me.

This version removes any speculation about the meaning or cause of your experience, leaving it open to interpretation. It presents the events plainly, allowing the reader to draw their own conclusions about the “mystery” of the encounter.
