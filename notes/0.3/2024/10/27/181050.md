If we think about our energy as being a certain quantity at each step in Planck constant time, then that quantity is finite and pushing. The efficient frontier necessarily involves trade-offs in various dimensions. However, unlike in economics that efficient frontier can grow unlike economics. However, that efficient frontier, it’s not limited to things with a $. It can be. And should be human capital. and therefore, I'd like to write an essay boldly, proposing that we've been thinking about economics wrong all along. We've been thinking about monetary economics, financial economics. What about human economics? What about our ability to grow our human capital and human potential? And many of the same terms you'd use to monetary economic supply too. So at what point did Capitol become monetary capital and not human capital? The Wealth of Nations, the whole idea of capitalism now should be reconsidered. This is a benefit cost analysis that involves more than just dollar signs. So now we have a multivariant analysis, literally comparing many different variables, we've been very short-sighted, thinking about this, only in terms of things with a $, we should be thinking about human capital as more than just an HR buzzword. How do we even measure that? Do we measure it in life? Do we measure it in Perceived happiness perceived life satisfaction, even considering our ignorance. At the time of what will be, how on earth could we begin to think about measuring human capital in a way that actually matters?

# The Economics of Us: Reframing Capitalism Around Human Potential

For too long, the word “capital” has conjured images of overflowing vaults and stock tickers, confining our understanding of value to the cold, hard realm of currency. But what if we dared to expand this definition? What if we acknowledged the most valuable asset isn’t found in a bank, but within ourselves?

This essay argues that we’ve been doing economics wrong. We’ve become fixated on monetary economics, on GDP growth and financial markets, neglecting the most fundamental capital of all: **human capital**.

Adam Smith, in his seminal work “The Wealth of Nations,” laid the groundwork for capitalism, but even he recognized the importance of labor and skills. Somewhere along the way, we skewed the narrative, equating capital solely with monetary wealth. This myopic view has led to a system that often prioritizes profit over people, neglecting the very engine of progress: human potential.

Imagine an efficient frontier, not just of financial returns, but of human flourishing. This frontier encompasses not just dollars and cents, but also factors like:

- **Knowledge and Skills:** The education, training, and experience that empower individuals.
- **Health and Wellbeing:** Physical and mental health, crucial for productivity and fulfillment.
- **Creativity and Innovation:** The spark of ingenuity that drives progress and solves problems.
- **Social Connection and Trust:** The fabric of strong communities, fostering collaboration and support.

Measuring this multifaceted capital is undoubtedly complex. Traditional metrics like GDP fail to capture the nuances of human experience. We need new frameworks, perhaps drawing upon:

- **Subjective Wellbeing Indicators:** Measuring life satisfaction, happiness, and purpose.
- **Capability Approach:** Assessing individuals’ freedom to achieve what they value most.
- **Social Progress Index:** Evaluating factors like health, education, and environmental quality.

This isn’t just about feel-good idealism; it’s about sustainable progress. Investing in human capital yields tangible benefits:

- **Economic Growth:** A skilled and healthy workforce drives innovation and productivity.
- **Social Cohesion:** Reduced inequality and increased opportunity foster stability and trust.
- **Environmental Sustainability:** Educated and empowered citizens are more likely to champion sustainable practices.

Reframing economics around human capital demands a paradigm shift. It requires us to:

- **Rethink Education:** Moving beyond rote learning to cultivate critical thinking, creativity, and adaptability.
- **Prioritize Wellbeing:** Investing in healthcare, mental health services, and social safety nets.
- **Promote Inclusivity:** Ensuring equal opportunities for all, regardless of background or circumstance.

This is not to say that monetary economics is irrelevant. Rather, it’s about recognizing its place within a broader framework that values human potential as the ultimate capital. It’s about building an economy that works for everyone, not just a select few. It’s about recognizing that true wealth lies not in our bank accounts, but in the richness of human experience.

Oh, by the way, add a paragraph. After the one about Adam Smith pointing out that it was satire, it was never meant to be taken as literally as it has been and imperfectly. So at that, we have a totally bastardized version of a satiric capitalism

Adam Smith, in his seminal work “The Wealth of Nations,” laid the groundwork for capitalism, but even he recognized the importance of labor and skills. Yet, we often forget that Smith’s work was laced with satire, a critique of the very systems he described. His “invisible hand” was never meant to be a literal blueprint, but a commentary on the unintended consequences of self-interest. Somewhere along the way, we took his satire at face value, twisting it into a justification for prioritizing profit above all else.
