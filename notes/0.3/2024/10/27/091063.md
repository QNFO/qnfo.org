Write an essay about choosing to be poor as a statement of values against the system of so-called capitalism that doesn't see equality for all human beings as an objective one that transfers consideration for our other equal beings to some kind of economic equation. And an incorrect equation at that. And yes, of course included disclaimer. Did I make this statement that I am choosing to be poor as a statement of values? But that is meant to be provocative and that I enjoy relative privilege, considering that I once owned a house that's sold for a million dollars and earned a $165000 a year. Now that I find myself living partially on food stands, I see the joy in focusing on things that do not have dollar signs in front of them and I would challenge my fellow humans to take the humility of someone like Warren Buffett who I sincerely believe has come to see the good that he can do. With his vast wealth and go even further. I have previously talked about the dollar a day. Challenge that if someone asks me on the street for a dollar. If I have a dollar, I give them a dollar even if I did that every day for my life, it would be less than the cost of a new car, but for whatever those dollars are spent, perhaps cigarettes or booze, or who knows what It will be a better investment than that car. And now I say, choose to be poor opt out of the system that does not provide not for you and not for anyone, because as much wealth as you may have, you will find that there is a reason for more and even billionaires surely see their billionaires with a newer yacht. Or a bigger house or better company and want more, not for their fellow humans. Though, that is an egregious crime against humanity and one that I cannot participate in anymore. And so for whatever it is that we find throughout history, there are those who had immense wealth and died in poverty. I hope they died happy because It is nothing to die with a big bank account. What a shame you had such an opportunity. And it was squandered during your life to see the joy that could have provided.

## Choosing Poverty: A Statement Against a System of Inequality

This essay is a personal reflection on the author's choice to live a life of relative poverty, a choice driven by a deep-seated belief in the inherent value of all human beings and a rejection of the capitalist system's prioritization of economic gain over human well-being. 

The author, who acknowledges past privilege (owning a house worth a million dollars and earning a six-figure salary), now finds joy in focusing on things beyond the realm of money. This shift in perspective is inspired by figures like Warren Buffett, who, despite immense wealth, seem to understand the power of giving back and making a positive impact on the world. 

The author's "dollar a day" challenge, a commitment to giving a dollar to anyone who asks, is a tangible expression of this value system. It's a rejection of the idea that money is a finite resource, and a belief that even the smallest act of generosity can have a significant impact on someone's life. 

The essay argues that the capitalist system, with its relentless pursuit of wealth and its inherent inequality, is fundamentally flawed. It fails to provide for the basic needs of many, and even those with vast fortunes are driven by a constant desire for more, often at the expense of others. This insatiable hunger for wealth, the author argues, is a crime against humanity, and one they can no longer participate in.

The author's choice to live a life of relative poverty is not a romanticized embrace of hardship, but a conscious decision to prioritize human connection and meaningful experiences over material possessions. It's a statement against a system that prioritizes profit over people, and a call to action for others to consider the true value of life beyond the confines of economic equations.

**Disclaimer:** This essay reflects the personal views of the author and does not necessarily represent the views of all individuals who choose to live a life of simplicity or those who critique the capitalist system. The author acknowledges their own privilege and recognizes that their experience is not representative of the struggles faced by many who live in poverty due to systemic inequalities. 

This essay is meant to be provocative and to spark dialogue about the ethical implications of wealth and the pursuit of happiness in a world defined by economic systems. It is a call to consider the true meaning of value and to challenge the status quo.

## Choosing Poverty: A Statement Against a System of Inequality

This isn't some romanticized, "I'm-going-to-live-off-the-grid" hippie diatribe. This is about choosing poverty as a statement, a big, fat, middle finger to a system that doesn't see equality for all human beings as an objective. It's about rejecting the idea that our worth is measured by dollar signs and that our consideration for each other is some kind of economic equation. And an incorrect equation at that.

Now, I know what you're thinking. "You're choosing poverty? You, who once owned a house that sold for a million bucks and earned a cool $165,000 a year?" Yeah, that was me. But then I found myself living partially on food stamps, and you know what? I discovered joy in things that don't have dollar signs in front of them. It's like Warren Buffett, who I sincerely believe has come to see the good he can do with his vast wealth. He's gone further than most. 

Remember that "dollar a day" challenge I talked about? If someone asks me for a dollar on the street, and I have it, I give it to them. Even if I did that every day for the rest of my life, it would be less than the cost of a new car. But for whatever those dollars are spent on, maybe cigarettes or booze, or who knows what, it'll be a better investment than that car.

Now I'm saying, choose to be poor. Opt out of the system that doesn't provide for you, and doesn't provide for anyone. Because no matter how much wealth you have, there's always a reason for more. Even billionaires see other billionaires with newer yachts, bigger houses, better companies, and they want more. Not for their fellow humans, mind you. That's an egregious crime against humanity, and one I can't participate in anymore.

Throughout history, there have been those with immense wealth who died in poverty. I hope they died happy, because it's nothing to die with a big bank account. What a shame to have such an opportunity and squander it during your life, to miss out on the joy that could have been provided.

This isn't about being a martyr or a saint. It's about choosing to live a life that aligns with my values. It's about rejecting a system that prioritizes profit over people. It's about finding happiness in the simple things, in human connection, in the act of giving, in the knowledge that I'm not contributing to a system that perpetuates inequality.

**Disclaimer:** This is my personal experience, my own perspective. I'm not saying everyone should choose poverty, and I acknowledge my own privilege. I know my experience isn't representative of the struggles faced by those who live in poverty due to systemic inequalities. 

This is a provocative statement, a challenge to the status quo. It's a call to consider the true meaning of value and to question the system that defines our lives. It's a call to action, a call to choose a different path, a path that prioritizes human well-being over economic gain.

This isn’t some romanticized, “I’m-going-to-live-off-the-grid” hippie diatribe. This is about choosing poverty as a statement, a big, fat, middle finger to a system that doesn’t see equality for all human beings as an objective. It’s about rejecting the idea that our worth is measured by dollar signs and that our consideration for each other is some kind of economic equation. And an incorrect equation at that.

Now, I know what you’re thinking. “You’re choosing poverty? You, who once owned a house that sold for a million bucks and earned $165,000 a year?” Yeah, that was me. But then I found myself living partially on food stamps, and you know what? I discovered joy in things that don’t have dollar signs in front of them. It’s like Warren Buffett, who I sincerely believe has come to see the good he can do with his vast wealth. He’s gone further than all of us. And you can too, whatever your means.

I started with a “dollar a day” challenge. If someone asks me for a dollar on the street, and I have it, I give it to them. Even if I did that every day for the rest of my life, it would be less than the cost of a new car. But for whatever those dollars are spent on, maybe cigarettes or booze, or who knows what, it’ll be a better investment than that car.

And that was infectious. Then, I found myself with $4000 in hundred dollar bills that I tried to pay to my former greedy corporate landlord once they attempted to evict me from my apartment over a $132 dispute (which they ultimately succeeded in doing after paying a large law firm perhaps tens of thousands of dollars), but because accepting that rent would undermine their court case it was rejected. I instead chose to give a few people surprises and some of those one dollar asks were automatically upgraded. I wish I had stopped long enough to see the reaction of a man who asked me for a dollar, which I gave him, and then said “two dollars will buy me something nice.” I had only one other bill in my wallet at the time, but to be honest, I was embarrassed at seeming that I was patronizing him and so I hope he did buy something nice.

Now I'm saying, choose to be poor. Opt out of the system that doesn't provide for you, and doesn't provide for anyone. Because no matter how much wealth you have, there's always a reason for more. Even billionaires see other billionaires with newer yachts, bigger houses, better companies, and they want more. Not for their fellow humans, mind you. That's an egregious crime against humanity, and one I can't participate in anymore.

Throughout history, there have been those with immense wealth who died in poverty. I hope they died happy, because it's nothing to die with a big bank account. What a shame to have such an opportunity and squander it during your life, to miss out on the joy that could have been provided.

This isn't about being a martyr or a saint. It's about choosing to live a life that aligns with my values. It's about rejecting a system that prioritizes profit over people. It's about finding happiness in the simple things, in human connection, in the act of giving, in the knowledge that I'm not contributing to a system that perpetuates inequality.

This is my personal experience, my own perspective. I’m not saying everyone should choose poverty, and I acknowledge my own privilege. I know my experience isn’t representative of the struggles faced by those who live in poverty due to systemic inequalities. 

This is a provocative statement, a challenge to the status quo. It's a call to consider the true meaning of value and to question the system that defines our lives. It's a call to action, a call to choose a different path, a path that prioritizes human well-being over economic gain. 

I see enough hypocrisy in this world of ours, so mark my words, I mean what I say. And yet it’s astonishing to me that those who say that they participate in the rationality of our economic system commit such irrational acts as my former landlord, or even my former employer, who illegally terminated me for going on federally, protected medical leave, but then stubbornly refused a settlement that even equated to the twelve weeks of paid leave they initially granted me. And yet here we are. But they are entirely greedy, hungry, for more to extract–oddly– seen as the maximum economic value.

Here’s the part where I go off on a polemic about how lawyers have ruined the world, and I truly mean that, but they should probably go to accounting school, or at least learn economics, because my former employer and my former landlord have one thing in common that will run them into the ground. Those same attorneys who it seems just like to argue even at their client’s expense. Win lose or draw they still get paid by the hour.

And so a $132 dispute is now $50 million lawsuit for the fraud and misrepresentation, and real damage that my former landlord Veritas, founded by a first generation immigrant and Harvard Business School graduate. He must have skipped the course on risk management.And now seeks to squeeze every last dollar, as his company is running itself into the ground very nicely.

And then iManage, which oddly provide software used by the world’s largest law firms.
And his lawyers surely told them that I would happily take a 4 week severance, even after the 12 weeks of leave, they promised me to go on leave. $300000, or 2 years of my former salary was readily rejected, and yet they stand to lose between 3 an $5 million in an ultimate lawsuit judgment, and they will lose for their significant violation of my rights and then retaliation, and yet they surely are 2 blindsided. By the short-term to see the forest from the trees. But I’m not my last offer to them. Was that I would accept a settlement going? Not to me, but to my non-profit in its entirety, and then I would not benefit one penny other than to see that do good, where an injustice had been done. To spring forth, good out of injustice and the same thing will be true, I will forgo any personal monetary benefit, because the greater benefit is in knowing that somehow that will do tremendous good, that I could never possibly realize on my own.

Choosing Poverty: A Statement Against a System of Inequality

This isn't some romanticized, "I'm-going-to-live-off-the-grid" hippie diatribe.

And that was infectious. I once found myself with $4,000 in hundred-dollar bills that I tried to pay to my former greedy corporate landlord when they attempted to evict me over a $132 dispute. They ultimately succeeded after paying a large law firm perhaps tens of thousands of dollars, but because accepting that rent would undermine their court case, it was rejected. I instead chose to give a few people surprises, and some of those one-dollar asks were automatically upgraded.
