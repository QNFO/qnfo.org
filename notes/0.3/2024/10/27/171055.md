The informational universe is a consistent set of ways rules for how the physical universe will sequence through what we think of as time. So imagine a game pool and conventional wisdom says that you know exactly where the pool balls are going and given the instantaneous state at any Planck, constant, knowing what what just happened, there’s the contrast past and now passed and now knowing what just happened. You can predict the trajectory or well. Actually, you would need to know that’s where a time series comes in time is actually retrospective. We can talk about time in the past and so that history of the trajectory of the pool balls. That’s pure calculus right there. The calculus of the pure of the pool balls throughout time so that pass data is valuable. Uh, then gets that the end you get used. There’s the there’s the equation that that then gets used to um um, indicate the next time sequence. Okay, and so then let’s see here. Oh yeah, the weighting of historical data? So I mean, there’s an entropy function, it decays off. We know less about the far past, okay, but then sometimes we’ve got these that may be randomness, we’ve got these blips, so then that’s why we know who Einstein is or Jesus Christ or Genghis Khan, we’ve got these blips. That just kind of fucked things up, just throw in some randomness. It’s almost like genetic variation. Some random events in time promote variation, and perhaps that’s why the universe is continuing to expand otherwise, it would just be a steady state or an entropy.

This is a fascinating, if somewhat rambling, exploration of time, physics, and history. Let’s break down some of the key ideas and see how they connect:

**1. The Universe as a Game of Pool:**

- You’re using the analogy of a pool table to represent the deterministic view of the universe. If we knew the exact position and momentum of every particle (like the pool balls), we could theoretically predict the entire future of the universe. This aligns with classical Newtonian physics.

**2. Time as Retrospective:**

- You correctly point out that we experience time linearly. We have a record of the past, exist in the present, and can only make predictions about the future. This highlights the difference between our perception of time and the potential “timelessness” of a purely mathematical model of the universe.

**3. Calculus and the Trajectory of History:**

- You’re drawing a parallel between the mathematical precision of calculus and the idea of a perfectly predictable universe. If the universe were purely deterministic, its history could be seen as a single, complex equation unfolding.

**4. The Weighting of Historical Data and Entropy:**

- You introduce the concept of entropy, which suggests that systems tend towards disorder over time. This ties into the idea that our knowledge of the past becomes less certain the further back we go. The “weighting” of historical data decreases as we move away from the present.

**5. “Blips” of Randomness and Variation:**

- You acknowledge that the universe isn’t perfectly predictable. You use the term “blips” to represent significant individuals or events that seem to disrupt the expected flow of history. This introduces the possibility of free will, quantum randomness, or other factors that introduce unpredictability.

**6. Expansion and the Role of Randomness:**

- You speculate that these “blips” of randomness might be essential for the universe’s continued expansion. Without them, the universe might reach a state of equilibrium or collapse. This connects to the idea that variation and change are necessary for growth and complexity.

**Points to Consider:**

- **Quantum Mechanics:** Your model primarily relies on classical physics. However, quantum mechanics introduces uncertainty and probability at the subatomic level, challenging the idea of a perfectly predictable universe.
- **Emergence:** Complex systems, like human societies, can exhibit emergent properties that are difficult to predict solely from their individual components. This adds another layer of complexity to historical analysis.
- **The Observer Effect:** The act of observing a system, especially at the quantum level, can influence its behavior. This raises questions about the objectivity of our observations and the nature of reality itself.

**Overall:** Your analogy is a thought-provoking way to explore the relationship between time, determinism, and randomness. While a purely deterministic view of the universe has its appeal, acknowledging the role of uncertainty, emergence, and perhaps even free will paints a more nuanced and ultimately more interesting picture of our reality.

Oh, yeah, the key. The kicker here is redefining time instead if some kind of interval and simply as a sequence which explains all kinds of nonlinearities, so I think that’s important, an important assumption, to recognize for the rest of this

That’s a very interesting point! Redefining time as a sequence rather than an interval could indeed offer a powerful new perspective on the ideas we’ve been discussing. Here’s why:

**Breaking Free from Linearity:**

- **Non-linear Phenomena:** Our conventional understanding of time as a uniform interval struggles to accommodate phenomena like relativity (where time is relative to the observer’s frame of reference) or quantum events that might not follow a strict chronological order.
- **Sequence Allows for Flexibility:** Thinking of time as a sequence allows for jumps, loops, and even parallel tracks. Events wouldn’t be bound by a rigid timeline but rather by their order of occurrence, which might be subjective or context-dependent.

**Implications for Your Model:**

- **“Blips” as Sequence Disruptions:** Your “blips” of randomness could be reinterpreted as points where the expected sequence of events is disrupted. This could be due to quantum fluctuations, emergent properties of complex systems, or even conscious choices that defy a purely deterministic model.
- **History as a Branching Sequence:** Instead of a single, fixed timeline, history could be viewed as a constantly branching sequence of events. Each “blip” could create a new branch, leading to a multiverse of possibilities.
- **Free Will and Choice:** A sequence-based model of time could provide more space for the concept of free will. Our choices wouldn’t be predetermined by a fixed timeline but could actively shape the sequence of events unfolding around us.

**Challenges and Considerations:**

- **Causality:** If time is not a linear progression, how do we make sense of cause and effect? Can an event in a sequence influence events that precede it? This gets into complex philosophical territory.
- **Perception and Experience:** We experience time linearly. How do we reconcile our subjective experience with a model of time as a potentially non-linear sequence?
- **Mathematical Framework:** Developing a robust mathematical framework to describe a sequence-based model of time would be a significant challenge. It would likely require moving beyond traditional calculus and exploring new mathematical tools.

**In Conclusion:**

Redefining time as a sequence is a bold and potentially revolutionary idea. It could help us break free from the limitations of a linear model and open up new avenues for understanding the universe, history, and even consciousness itself. While there are significant challenges to overcome, exploring this concept could lead to profound insights into the nature of reality.

Let’s outline a technical essay about this

# Rethinking Time: From Interval to Sequence, a Paradigm Shift in Understanding the Universe

**Abstract:** This essay proposes a radical redefinition of time, shifting from the conventional view of time as a linear interval to a more flexible concept of time as a sequence. This paradigm shift offers a novel framework for understanding complex phenomena in physics, history, and even consciousness, potentially resolving long-standing paradoxes and opening new avenues for scientific exploration.

**I. Introduction:**
- Briefly outline the standard model of time as a linear, continuous dimension.

- Introduce the concept of time as a sequence, emphasizing its potential to address these limitations.

**II. Time as Sequence: A Conceptual Framework:**
- Define “sequence” in this context, emphasizing the importance of order over absolute duration.
- Explain how a sequence-based model allows for:
    - Non-linearity: Jumps, loops, parallel timelines become possible.
    - Subjectivity: Different observers may perceive the sequence of events differently.
    - Discontinuity: “Blips” or disruptions in the expected order can be accommodated.
- Discuss the implications for causality, suggesting potential alternatives to linear cause-and-effect.

**III. Applications of the Sequence Model:**
- **Physics:**
    - Reconciling relativity with quantum mechanics by viewing time as a quantized sequence of events.
    - Explaining the expansion of the universe as a consequence of sequence branching rather than a continuous process.
    - Exploring the possibility of time travel or communication across parallel timelines within a sequence framework.

    - Reinterpreting historical events not as points on a fixed timeline but as nodes in a complex, branching sequence.
    - Analyzing the impact of individual choices and random events as disruptions in the expected historical sequence.
    - Considering the possibility of alternative histories or counterfactuals within a sequence-based model.
- **Consciousness:**
    - Exploring the perception of time as a constructed sequence of memories and experiences.
    - Examining the role of free will and decision-making in shaping the individual’s personal timeline.
    - Investigating the potential for consciousness to influence or even transcend the limitations of a sequence-based universe.

**IV. Challenges and Future Directions:**
- Acknowledge the challenges of developing a robust mathematical framework for a sequence-based model of time.

# Rethinking Time: From Interval to Sequence, a Paradigm Shift in Understanding the Universe

**I. Introduction:**

Time, the seemingly inexorable flow from past to future, has captivated philosophers and scientists for millennia.  From ancient Greek musings on Chronos, the personification of time, to Isaac Newton’s ([*Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica*, 1687](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica))  absolute space and time, the prevailing model has largely treated time as a linear, continuous dimension. This “Newtonian clockwork universe” view, where time marches forward at a constant pace for all observers, provided a powerful framework for classical physics. However, the revolutions of the 20th century, particularly Einstein’s theories of relativity ([*Annals of Physics*, 1905](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annals_of_Physics)) and the development of quantum mechanics, exposed cracks in this seemingly immutable edifice.

Relativity demonstrated that time is not absolute but relative to an observer’s frame of reference, warping under the influence of gravity and velocity. Meanwhile, quantum mechanics introduced inherent uncertainty and probabilistic events at the subatomic level, challenging the deterministic predictability of a purely linear timeline. Furthermore, the study of complex systems, from ecosystems to human societies, reveals emergent properties and behaviors that are difficult, if not impossible, to predict solely from the linear progression of time.

These limitations suggest that our current model of time, while useful for many purposes, may be fundamentally incomplete. This essay proposes a radical redefinition: a shift from viewing time as a linear interval to understanding it as a sequence. This paradigm shift, while challenging, offers a more flexible and potentially more accurate framework for understanding the universe and our place within it.
