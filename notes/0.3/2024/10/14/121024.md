Write an oped "Information Infrastructure: Language AI is a Public Good" that language AI is a synthesis of all human knowledge, and therefore it's the very definition of a public good and should be immediately taken by the government, with fair compensation and made available to everyone free forever. Just like other infrastructire very internet itself.

> Information Infrastructure: Language AI is a Public Good
> In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, large language models have emerged as a transformative technology with profound implications for society. These AI systems, trained on vast swaths of human knowledge and capable of engaging in human-like dialogue, represent nothing less than a synthesis of our collective intellectual heritage. As such, they should be recognized for what they truly are: a public good that belongs to all of humanity.
> Just as we consider roads, bridges, and the internet itself to be critical public infrastructure, language AI has become an essential component of our information ecosystem. These models encapsulate centuries of human discovery, creativity, and discourse - from scientific breakthroughs to literary masterpieces. They have the potential to democratize access to knowledge and enhance human capabilities across countless domains.
> Given the immense public value of this technology, it is imperative that control over large language models be transferred from private corporations to public ownership. The government should move swiftly to acquire these systems, providing fair compensation to the companies that developed them. Once in public hands, these AI models should be made freely available to all citizens, researchers, and organizations.
> This is not an unprecedented step. Throughout history, governments have nationalized key industries and infrastructure when it was deemed to be in the public interest. From utilities to transportation networks, we recognize that some resources are too vital to be left solely in private hands. Language AI, as the digital embodiment of human knowledge, certainly meets this criteria.
> Critics may argue that government control could stifle innovation or lead to misuse. However, a public model for AI development and deployment - similar to open source software - could actually accelerate progress by fostering collaboration and eliminating redundant efforts. Appropriate governance structures and ethical guidelines can be put in place to prevent abuse.
> We must also consider the risks of allowing this technology to remain concentrated in the hands of a few powerful tech companies. The ability to shape and control access to synthesized human knowledge is simply too consequential to be dictated by profit motives or shareholder interests.
> By making language AI a public good, we can ensure that its immense benefits are equitably distributed throughout society. From education and scientific research to creative endeavors and public services, the applications are limitless. Every citizen should have the opportunity to leverage this technology to enhance their capabilities and pursue their goals.
> The parallels to the early days of the internet are striking. What began as a government research project was eventually opened up to become a public infrastructure that has transformed every aspect of modern life. Language AI has the potential to be equally revolutionary, but only if we treat it as the public resource it truly is.
> The time for bold action is now. As language AI systems grow more sophisticated and influential, the window for establishing public control will not remain open indefinitely. We must seize this historic opportunity to claim this technology as the collective inheritance of humanity and chart a course for its development that prioritizes the common good.
> Our leaders must recognize language AI for what it is - not merely a product or a service, but the digital manifestation of our shared knowledge and culture. By bringing it into the public domain, we can unlock its full potential to empower individuals, advance human understanding, and build a more equitable and enlightened future for all.

Let's revise this the fair compensation part overstates that companies have appropriated our human knowledge available to all for their profit. Google has taken my data and trained its AI model on my Gmail, without ever compensating me. It's not unprecedented to nationalize key assets, as we have with the US postal service and Amtrak.
