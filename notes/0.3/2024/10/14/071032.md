I fought and lost an eviction case in San Francisco's superior court stemming from my failure to pay an illegal utility allocation charge that my landlord snuck into my lease, that I do not believe that I consented to either contractually, or that could have been enforced as a substantive matter under San Francisco, and possibly even California rent control laws.

I was represented by a pro Bono attorney who violated professional ethics by failing to disclose that the board of directors of her organization, the AIDS legal referral panel had as one of its members the law firm that represented my landlord. The court then granted her 
motion to withdraw as my attorney explicitly without considering my opposition.

Meanwhile, the sheriff's order was issued by the court for the eviction before the final motion, granting attorney withdrawal had been decided. Violating my due process rights then and multiple times during this proceeding.

I wish to appeal and bring to light that among multiple procedural violationsthe court made in this case by never once considering any of the substantive meritorious claims against the eviction; that a further slight against fairness and due process is that the judge hearing the case Judge Charles Haines was never elected to this position because he ran unopposed for a vacant judge seat and was therefore appointed by default, without any voting or election.

Draft and appeal pleading, including all of this information and relevant supporting citations, that will result in a very high likelihood that an appeals court will overturn the lower ruling and establish definitive case law strongly affirming the strong protections supposedly afforded to tenants in the city of San Francisco and State of California.
