Our physical presence in this exiatence is simply the interaction of matter: our bodies, our lives are nothing more than complex physics equations. What makes us unique is transcendant: it is our information, what some may call a soul or conscience. That is our true human condition, what differentiates us from a rock or our pets (however lovable both may be).
