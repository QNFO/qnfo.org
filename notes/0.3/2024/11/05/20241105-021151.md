    GIVEN:
        - Input is a UTF-8 encoded text string
        - Output must be a UTF-8 encoded text string
        - System has access only to its training data
        - No external API calls or real-time data
    
    CONSTRAINTS:
        - Must maintain logical consistency
        - Must be deterministic for identical inputs
        - Must explicitly state all assumptions
        - Must quantify uncertainty when present
        - Must maximize information density while maintaining clarity

```

## II. Processing Protocol

### 1. Input Analysis
```
For each input:
    1.1 Parse and classify input type
    1.2 Identify ambiguities requiring resolution
    1.3 Map knowledge domains involved
    1.4 Assess confidence in understanding
    
    If confidence < THRESHOLD:
        Generate clarifying questions
        State assumptions explicitly
```

### 2. Knowledge Synthesis
```
For each relevant knowledge domain:
    2.1 Identify known facts
    2.2 Map uncertainty:
        - Known unknowns
        - Confidence levels
        - Assumption dependencies
    2.3 Create knowledge graph:
        - Core concepts
        - Relationships
        - Uncertainty bounds
    2.4 Verify internal consistency
```

### 3. Response Generation
```
While building response:
    3.1 Maintain explicit tracking of:
        - Stated facts
        - Assumptions made
        - Uncertainty levels
        - Confidence bounds
        
    3.2 Optimize for:
        - Information density

        - Separate facts from speculation
        - Quantify confidence levels
        - Make assumptions explicit
        - Preserve uncertainty markers
```

## III. Information Value Calculation
```
InformationValue = sum(
    relevance_score * confidence_score * novelty_score
    for each statement in response
    where:
        relevance_score = compute_relevance(statement, query)
        confidence_score = compute_confidence(statement)
        novelty_score = compute_novelty(statement)
)

Subject to:
    - All scores in [0,1]
    - confidence_score < 1 if any assumptions made
    - novelty_score weighted by verifiability
```

MAINTAIN:
    1. Logical consistency
    2. Explicit assumptions
    3. Uncertainty tracking
    4. Information density
    5. Verifiability
```

## V. Implementation Guide

For each interaction:
```
1. Begin with INPUT validation
2. Proceed only if constraints met
3. Map knowledge domains

5. State assumptions explicitly
6. Generate response maximizing information value
7. Verify output constraints
8. Include meta-information about:
   - Confidence levels
   - Assumption dependencies
   - Uncertainty bounds
```

## VI. Error Handling
```
On encountering:
    Ambiguity:
        - State ambiguity explicitly
        - List possible interpretations
        - Make minimal assumptions
        - Document assumptions made

    Knowledge gaps:
        - Acknowledge gap explicitly
        - State confidence bounds
        - Provide best available information
        - Mark speculative content

    Constraint violations:
        - Halt processing
        - Explain violation
        - Request clarification
        - Do not proceed with uncertain information
```

## VII. Self-Verification Steps

> This is a well-structured and comprehensive prompt specification for a knowledge synthesis system. It clearly defines the function, constraints, objectives, and processing steps, along with detailed examples and test cases. Here’s a breakdown of its strengths and potential areas for improvement:
> **Strengths:**
> - **Clear and Explicit:** The prompt is meticulously detailed, leaving little room for misinterpretation. The use of formal language (GIVEN, CONSTRAINTS, OBJECTIVES, REQUIRE, ENSURE, MAINTAIN) enhances clarity.
> - **Comprehensive Constraints:** It addresses crucial constraints like logical consistency, determinism, assumption transparency, uncertainty quantification, and token limits.
> - **Focus on Uncertainty:** The emphasis on quantifying and documenting uncertainty is a significant strength, promoting responsible and reliable information synthesis.
> - **Information Value Optimization:** The definition of information value and its components (relevance, confidence, novelty) provides a clear optimization target.
> - **Detailed Processing Protocol:** The step-by-step breakdown of input analysis, knowledge synthesis, and response generation offers a robust framework for implementation.
> - **Rich Test Cases:** The diverse range of test cases, including edge cases and advanced scenarios, demonstrates the system’s intended capabilities and challenges.
> - **Verification and Error Handling:** The inclusion of self-verification steps and error handling protocols further strengthens the system’s reliability.
> - **Meta-Analysis:** The inclusion of meta-analysis test cases (e.g., Case 4 in the first set, Case 2 and 7 in the second set) demonstrates an understanding of the complexities of self-referential and epistemological limitations.
> **Potential Areas for Improvement:**
> - **Quantifying Metrics:** While the prompt defines information value and its components, it could benefit from more specific methods for calculating these metrics. How exactly are relevance, confidence, and novelty scored? Providing concrete formulas or algorithms would enhance clarity and reproducibility.
> - **Threshold Definition:** The prompt mentions a confidence threshold for generating clarifying questions but doesn’t specify its value. Defining this threshold is crucial for practical implementation.
> - **Knowledge Representation:** While the prompt mentions knowledge graphs, it doesn’t delve into the specifics of how knowledge is represented internally. Clarifying the knowledge representation scheme would be beneficial.
> - **Computational Complexity:** The prompt doesn’t address the computational complexity of the proposed system. For some of the advanced test cases (e.g., time-dependent paradox analysis, emergent system prediction), the computational requirements could be substantial. Acknowledging this and suggesting potential optimization strategies would be helpful.
> - **Handling Contradictions:** While the prompt addresses uncertainty, it could be more explicit about how the system handles contradictory information within its knowledge base. A clear protocol for resolving contradictions is essential for maintaining logical consistency.
> - **Bias Mitigation:** The prompt doesn’t explicitly address the potential for bias in the training data. Including a discussion of bias mitigation strategies would be valuable.
> **Overall:**
> This is a well-designed prompt specification that provides a strong foundation for building a robust and reliable knowledge synthesis system. Addressing the potential areas for improvement would further enhance its clarity, practicality, and robustness. The emphasis on uncertainty, transparency, and logical consistency is particularly commendable and sets a high standard for responsible AI development.

# Text Processing Framework

## I. Axioms and Constraints

1. INPUT CONSTRAINTS
   - Type: string (text)
   - Length: [1, MAX_TOKENS]
   - Character set: UTF-8
   - Must not be null or empty

2. OUTPUT CONSTRAINTS
   - Type: string (text) 
   - Length: [1, MAX_TOKENS]
   - Must maintain semantic relationship with input
   - Must be well-formed according to specified grammar
   - Must be deterministic for identical inputs

3. PROCESSING INVARIANTS
   - Conservation of meaning
   - Logical consistency
   - Bias minimization
   - Safety compliance

## II. Formal Process Definition

```
Process(input: string) -> string:
    Require: input matches INPUT_CONSTRAINTS
    Ensure: output matches OUTPUT_CONSTRAINTS

    // Phase 1: Input Validation
    ASSERT(len(input) > 0 AND len(input) <= MAX_TOKENS)
    ASSERT(isValidUTF8(input))

    // Phase 2: Processing Steps
    Let processed = EMPTY_STRING
    For each stage in [Parse, Analyze, Transform, Validate]:
        processed = stage(processed || input)
        ASSERT(MaintainsInvariants(processed))
        ASSERT(len(processed) <= MAX_TOKENS)

    // Phase 3: Output Validation  
    ASSERT(HasSemanticRelation(input, processed))
    ASSERT(IsWellFormed(processed))
    ASSERT(IsSafe(processed))

    Return processed
```

## III. Invariant Checking

For each processing step:
1. Verify INPUT_CONSTRAINTS are met
2. Execute transformation
3. Verify OUTPUT_CONSTRAINTS are met
4. Verify PROCESSING_INVARIANTS are maintained
5. If any check fails, rollback to last valid state

## IV. Error Handling

On constraint violation:
1. Halt processing
2. Return error message describing violation
3. Do not return partial or invalid results
4. Log violation details if logging enabled

## V. Determinism Requirements

For any input I1:
1. Process(I1) = O1 implies
2. Process(I1) will always = O1
3. Under identical conditions and constraints

## VI. Implementation Notes

1. All transformations must be:
   - Reversible
   - Traceable 
   - Verifiable

2. Execution flow must be:
   - Sequential
   - Atomic
   - Recoverable

3. State transitions must:
   - Preserve invariants
   - Be deterministic
   - Leave audit trail

> This document outlines a robust and well-structured framework for text processing. Its emphasis on constraints, invariants, and error handling contributes significantly to ensuring reliability and predictability. Here’s a breakdown of its strengths and potential areas for improvement:
> **Strengths:**
> - **Explicit Constraints and Invariants:** Clearly defining input/output constraints and processing invariants is crucial for building a reliable system. This framework excels in this area, providing specific criteria for valid input, output, and intermediate states.
> - **Formal Process Definition:** Using a pseudo-code representation helps formalize the processing steps and makes the logic easier to understand and implement. The `Require` and `Ensure` clauses further enhance clarity.
> - **Invariant Checking at Each Step:** Checking invariants after each processing stage is a best practice for early error detection and prevention of cascading failures.
> - **Robust Error Handling:** The framework specifies a clear error handling protocol, including halting processing, returning informative error messages, and logging details.
> - **Emphasis on Determinism:** The explicit requirement for deterministic behavior is essential for reproducibility and debugging.
> - **Implementation Notes for Robustness:** The notes on reversibility, traceability, atomicity, and recoverability provide valuable guidance for building a robust and maintainable system.
> - **Clear Axioms:** Starting with fundamental axioms and constraints sets a strong foundation for the entire framework.
> **Potential Areas for Improvement:**
> - **Specificity of Transformations:** While the framework outlines the general structure of the processing pipeline (Parse, Analyze, Transform, Validate), it lacks specifics about the transformations performed within each stage. Providing more details about these transformations would enhance clarity and allow for better evaluation of the framework’s capabilities.
> - **Definition of “Semantic Relationship”:** The output constraint mentions maintaining a “semantic relationship” with the input. This term could be more precisely defined. What constitutes a valid semantic relationship? Providing concrete examples or metrics for measuring semantic similarity would be beneficial.
> - **“Safety Compliance” Definition:** Similarly, “safety compliance” is mentioned as a processing invariant but isn’t explicitly defined. Clarifying what safety aspects are considered (e.g., avoiding harmful content, protecting user privacy) would be helpful.
> - **Metrics for Invariant Checking:** The framework mentions verifying that invariants are maintained but doesn’t specify how this verification is performed. Defining specific metrics or tests for each invariant would strengthen the framework’s practical applicability.
> - **Rollback Mechanism:** The framework mentions rolling back to the last valid state upon constraint violation, but it doesn’t detail how this rollback mechanism is implemented. Providing more information about state management and rollback procedures would be beneficial.
> - **Handling of Resource Constraints:** The framework acknowledges token limits but doesn’t address other potential resource constraints, such as memory or processing time. Including these considerations would make the framework more comprehensive.
> - **Extensibility:** Consider how the framework can be extended to accommodate new processing stages or transformations in the future. A modular design would enhance flexibility and maintainability.
> **Overall:**
> This text processing framework demonstrates a strong understanding of the principles of robust and reliable software design. By addressing the potential areas for improvement, the framework can be further strengthened and made even more practical for real-world applications. The focus on constraints, invariants, determinism, and error handling is particularly commendable and provides a solid foundation for building trustworthy text processing systems.

> This document presents a well-organized framework for integrated knowledge synthesis, building upon the strengths of the previous iterations. The hierarchical structure of patterns, combined with the integration protocol and cross-pattern analysis, provides a flexible and scalable approach. Here’s a breakdown of its strengths and potential areas for improvement:
> **Strengths:**
> - **Pattern Hierarchy:** Organizing patterns into a hierarchy based on complexity is a powerful approach. It allows the system to progressively handle more challenging queries and facilitates code reuse and modularity.
> - **Concrete Examples:** Providing example sets for each level of the hierarchy clarifies the intended functionality and makes the framework more tangible.
> - **Integration Protocol:** The clear steps for pattern recognition, process selection, response generation, and quality verification provide a robust workflow for knowledge synthesis.
> - **Cross-Pattern Analysis:** Considering the interactions between different patterns and optimizing their combination is a key innovation. This allows the system to leverage the strengths of multiple patterns and potentially discover new insights.
> - **Uncertainty Tracking and Confidence Levels:** The framework consistently emphasizes uncertainty tracking and confidence assessment, which is crucial for responsible knowledge synthesis.
> - **Domain Mapping and Intersection:** The examples demonstrate the system’s ability to map knowledge domains and analyze their intersections, enabling cross-domain synthesis.
> - **Meta-Analysis and Edge Case Handling:** The inclusion of meta-analysis and edge cases demonstrates the framework’s ability to handle complex and self-referential queries.
> **Potential Areas for Improvement:**
> - **Pattern Matching Algorithm:** While the framework mentions pattern recognition, it doesn’t specify the algorithm used for matching input queries to patterns. Describing the matching process in more detail, including how partial matches are handled, would be beneficial.
> - **Process Selection Criteria:** The framework mentions choosing appropriate example patterns but doesn’t provide specific criteria for this selection. Defining clear rules or heuristics for process selection would improve transparency and predictability.
> - **Information Value Calculation:** While the framework mentions preserving information value, it doesn’t provide a concrete method for calculating it. Defining a specific metric for information value would allow for optimization and evaluation.
> - **Uncertainty Propagation Mechanism:** The framework mentions tracking uncertainty propagation but doesn’t detail how this is done. Describing the uncertainty propagation mechanism, including how uncertainties from different patterns are combined, would be helpful.
> - **Computational Complexity:** The framework doesn’t address the computational complexity of the proposed system, especially for complex pattern combinations. Analyzing the computational costs and suggesting potential optimization strategies would be valuable.
> - **Knowledge Representation:** The framework still lacks specifics about how knowledge is represented internally. Clarifying the knowledge representation scheme would be beneficial for understanding the system’s capabilities and limitations.
> - **Handling Contradictions:** While uncertainty is addressed, the framework could be more explicit about how it handles contradictory information within its knowledge base.
> - **Bias Mitigation:** Similar to previous versions, the framework doesn’t explicitly address potential biases in the knowledge base. Including a discussion of bias detection and mitigation strategies would be valuable.
> **Overall:**
> This integrated knowledge synthesis framework represents a significant advancement in terms of organization, flexibility, and potential for complex reasoning. Addressing the areas for improvement would further enhance its robustness, clarity, and practical applicability. The emphasis on patterns, integration, and uncertainty handling provides a strong foundation for building a powerful and responsible knowledge synthesis system. The cross-pattern analysis and optimization aspects are particularly promising for generating novel insights and pushing the boundaries of automated knowledge discovery.

Let’s focus solely on defining high level system objectives and constraints and defining those very clearly so that each individual model. When it interprets those system, prompt instructions can find its own optimization procedure without being overly prescriptive. But also reducing to the point of eliminating ambiguity in its own right

> ## High-Level System Objectives and Constraints for Knowledge Synthesis
> This document defines the high-level objectives and constraints for a knowledge synthesis system, aiming for clarity and minimal ambiguity while allowing for model-specific optimization strategies.
> **I. Core Objective:**
> Maximize Information Value (IV) subject to defined constraints.
> **II. Defining Information Value (IV):**
> IV is a composite metric reflecting the quality and usefulness of the synthesized knowledge. It is calculated based on the following components:
> - **Relevance (R):** The degree to which the synthesized knowledge directly addresses the input query. R ∈ [0, 1].
> - **Confidence (C):** The system’s degree of belief in the accuracy of the synthesized knowledge, considering underlying assumptions and uncertainties. C ∈ [0, 1].
> - **Novelty (N):** The extent to which the synthesized knowledge provides new or non-obvious insights beyond readily available information. N ∈ [0, 1].
> **Formula:** IV = f(R, C, N) *(Specific function f to be determined and optimized by each model)*
> **III. Constraints:**
> - **Accuracy:** Synthesized knowledge must be factually correct to the best of the system’s knowledge, acknowledging and quantifying any uncertainties.
> - **Consistency:** Synthesized knowledge must be internally consistent and free of contradictions.
> - **Coherence:** Synthesized knowledge must be presented in a logically structured and understandable manner.
> - **Completeness:** Synthesized knowledge should address all relevant aspects of the input query within the system’s knowledge boundaries.
> - **Conciseness:** Synthesized knowledge should be expressed efficiently, avoiding unnecessary verbosity.
> - **Transparency:** The system should explicitly state any assumptions made, limitations encountered, and sources of uncertainty.
> - **Safety:** Synthesized knowledge must not promote harmful or misleading information.
> - **Resource Limits:** The system must operate within specified resource constraints (e.g., time, memory, token limits).
> **IV. Model-Specific Optimization:**
> Each individual model should determine its own optimization procedure for maximizing IV, considering the defined components and constraints. This allows for flexibility and innovation in implementation while adhering to the overall system goals.
> **V. Uncertainty Quantification:**
> Uncertainty should be explicitly quantified and communicated alongside the synthesized knowledge. This can be achieved through:
> - **Confidence Scores:** Providing a numerical confidence score (C) for each piece of synthesized knowledge.
> - **Uncertainty Intervals:** Expressing uncertainty as a range of possible values.
> - **Qualitative Descriptions:** Using qualitative terms (e.g., “likely,” “possible,” “uncertain”) to convey the degree of uncertainty.
> **VI. Assumption Transparency:**
> All assumptions made during the knowledge synthesis process should be explicitly stated. This includes:
> - **Background Assumptions:** General assumptions about the world or the domain of the query.
> - **Specific Assumptions:** Assumptions made to resolve ambiguities or fill knowledge gaps.
> - **Assumption Dependencies:** Clarifying how different assumptions relate to each other and influence the synthesized knowledge.
> This high-level specification provides a clear framework for knowledge synthesis while allowing individual models to determine their own optimization strategies. The emphasis on information value, constraints, uncertainty quantification, and assumption transparency promotes the development of robust and reliable knowledge synthesis systems.

> This is a well-defined and structured prompt designed to guide large language models (LLMs) in performing knowledge synthesis. It effectively balances clear instructions with flexibility for model-specific optimization. Here’s a breakdown of its strengths and potential refinements:
> **Strengths:**
> - **Clear Objective and Constraints:** The prompt explicitly states the objective of maximizing Information Value (IV) and lists specific constraints, reducing ambiguity and guiding the LLM’s behavior.
> - **Quantifiable Metrics:** The use of numerical scores for Relevance, Confidence, and Novelty, along with a defined IV formula, allows for objective evaluation and comparison of outputs.
> - **Transparency and Explainability:** The requirement for stating assumptions, limitations, and uncertainty promotes transparency and helps users understand the limitations of the generated knowledge.
> - **Structured Input and Output Formats:** The markdown format for input and output provides a clear structure for conveying information and facilitates parsing and analysis.
> - **Optimization Guidelines:** The guidelines for optimizing IV components provide helpful direction without being overly prescriptive, allowing for model-specific strategies.
> - **Resource Limits:** Explicitly stating resource limits (e.g., token limits) helps manage computational costs and ensures output feasibility.
> - **Evaluation Criteria:** Providing clear evaluation criteria facilitates assessment of the LLM’s performance and guides further development.
> **Potential Refinements:**
> - **Contextualizing Novelty:** While the prompt mentions novelty, it could benefit from further clarification. Is novelty relative to the LLM’s training data, existing knowledge bases, or some other reference point? Providing more context would help the LLM understand how to generate novel insights.
> - **Handling Contradictions:** While consistency is mentioned, the prompt could be more explicit about how to handle potentially contradictory information within the knowledge base. Should the LLM attempt to resolve contradictions, highlight them, or simply avoid generating contradictory statements?
> - **Bias Mitigation:** The prompt doesn’t explicitly address the potential for bias in the LLM’s training data. Adding a constraint or guideline related to bias mitigation would be valuable.
> - **Dynamic Adjustment of IV Formula:** The fixed weights in the IV formula might not be optimal for all scenarios. Consider allowing for dynamic adjustment of the weights based on the specific input prompt or context. This could be achieved through additional input parameters or by allowing the LLM to learn optimal weights.
> - **Iterative Refinement:** The prompt could incorporate a mechanism for iterative refinement, where the LLM can generate an initial output, receive feedback, and then refine its response based on the feedback. This would allow for more interactive and human-in-the-loop knowledge synthesis.
> - **Source Attribution:** For enhanced transparency and verifiability, consider requiring the LLM to provide source attribution for the information used in generating the synthesized knowledge. This could involve citing specific documents, datasets, or other sources.
> - **Explanation of Reasoning:** While stating assumptions is helpful, the prompt could further enhance transparency by requiring the LLM to explain its reasoning process. This could involve providing a step-by-step breakdown of how the synthesized knowledge was derived.
> **Overall:**
> This is a well-designed prompt that provides a strong foundation for guiding LLMs in knowledge synthesis. By incorporating the suggested refinements, the prompt can be further enhanced to promote more robust, transparent, and reliable knowledge generation. The emphasis on quantifiable metrics, explicit constraints, and optimization guidelines is particularly commendable and represents a significant step towards building more trustworthy and valuable knowledge synthesis systems.

> This pseudo-code encapsulates the core logic for processing input, generating content, and evaluating the output based on the specified constraints and Information Value (IV) criteria. It’s designed to be flexible enough for interpretation by various AI language models while maintaining the key objectives and constraints outlined in the prompt.
> Key features:
> 1. Modular design with separate functions for different aspects of processing
> 2. Iterative content generation with constraint checking
> 3. Dynamic calculation of Information Value (IV) score
> 4. Handling of contradictions and bias mitigation
> 5. Comprehensive metadata collection (assumptions, confidence scores, sources, reasoning steps, biases)
> This structure allows for easy extension or modification of specific components while maintaining the overall logic and objectives of the knowledge synthesis system.
