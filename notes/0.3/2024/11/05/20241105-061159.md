 You’re right. Let me reconstruct this from first principles as a clear system prompt algorithm.

> Key improvements in this version:
> - **Clearer Input/Output Relationships:** Each step in the `PROCESS` now explicitly defines its input and output, making the data flow much more understandable.
> - **Constraint Application:** The `APPLY_CONSTRAINTS` step is introduced to ensure the response adheres to defined rules.
> - **Uncertainty Qualifiers as a Set:** `QUALIFY_INFORMATION` now outputs a set of qualifiers, allowing for more nuanced expression of uncertainty.
> - **Finalization Step:** A `FINALIZE_RESPONSE` step combines the structured response, qualifiers, and limitations into the final output.
> - **Confidence Range for Uncertain Knowledge:** A specific range is provided for `UNCERTAIN` knowledge, adding more precision.
> - **Uncertainty Value in Example 3:** A concrete uncertainty value is given in Example 3 for better illustration.
> This refined structure provides a more robust and detailed algorithm for optimizing LLM responses, emphasizing clarity, traceability, and the proper handling of uncertainty and limitations. It’s designed to be more easily implemented and understood by both humans and machines.

It reinforces the importance of truth, uncertainty acknowledgment, and ethical considerations in LLM responses. The edge cases demonstrate how the system adapts to various levels of certainty and knowledge availability.

> This version uses a more structured, set-based dictionary style for representing variables and their potential values or ranges. This enhances clarity and allows for easier parsing and interpretation by both humans and machines. It also explicitly defines the feasibility assessment step and includes uncertainty values in the edge cases. This provides a more comprehensive and robust framework for LLM response optimization.

Refactor the complete system prompt algorithm for consistent logic and coding style.I think a set/dictionary based approach similar to key values in a Jason script are most appropriate, considering that both natural language and machine-readable code. Are necessary to formalize a hybrid logic? That considers the strengths of both in

Consider alternate algorithm logic and syntax. I don’t like that. There are arbitrary variable nam

> You’re right to point out the arbitrary nature of some variable names. A more robust and generalized approach would use a schema-like structure that defines the *types* of information being processed rather than specific, potentially limiting names. This allows for greater flexibility and adaptability to different domains and query types.

> **Key Improvements and Explanations:**
> - **JSON Schema:** Using a formal schema allows for validation and ensures data consistency. This is crucial for robust processing.
> - **Generic Naming:** Instead of names like `EXTRACT_INTENT`, we use broader terms like `query` and `context`. This makes the schema applicable to a wider range of tasks.
> - **Flexible Context:** The `context` object uses `additionalProperties: true` to allow for any key-value pairs, accommodating diverse contextual information.
> - **Structured Response:** The `response` object includes fields for `content`, `confidence`, `limitations`, and optional `sources`. This provides a standardized format for LLM outputs.
> - **Confidence Score:** The `confidence` score provides a quantifiable measure of certainty.
> - **Limitations Acknowledgment:** The `limitations` array allows the LLM to explicitly state its limitations.
> - **Optional Sources:** The `sources` array allows for traceability and transparency.
> **Example Instance (Valid according to the schema):**
> ```json
> {
> "query": "What is the capital of France?",
> "context": {
> "user_location": "London",
> "time_of_day": "morning"
> },
> "response": {
> "content": "The capital of France is Paris.",
> "confidence": 1.0,
> "limitations": [],
> "sources": ["Wikipedia"]
> }
> }
> ```
> **Another Example (with uncertainty):**
> ```json
> {
> "query": "Will it rain tomorrow in Paris?",
> "context": {},
> "response": {
> "content": "There is a 60% chance of rain tomorrow in Paris.",
> "confidence": 0.8,
> "limitations": ["Weather forecasts are subject to change."],
> "sources": ["Weather.com"]
> }
> }
> ```
> This schema-based approach offers a more flexible, robust, and standardized way to represent the LLM response optimization process. It avoids arbitrary variable names and promotes clear communication between different components of the system. It also facilitates data validation and integration with other systems. This is a significant improvement over previous iterations.

> **Key Improvements:**
> - **`uncertainty_reasoning`:** Added a field to explain *why* a certain confidence level was assigned. This adds transparency and helps users understand the LLM’s reasoning.
> - **`alternative_interpretations`:** Allows the LLM to suggest other possible interpretations of ambiguous queries, each with its own confidence score. This promotes a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding.
> - **Clearer Descriptions:** Improved descriptions for better understanding of each field’s purpose.
> - **Required Fields:** `query` and `response` are now explicitly required, ensuring the core elements are always present.
> - **Simplified Structure:** Removed unnecessary nesting to improve readability and maintainability.
> **Example illustrating `uncertainty_reasoning` and `alternative_interpretations`:**
> ```json
> {
> "query": "Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953?",
> "context": {},
> "response": {
> "content": "Winston Churchill won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953.",

> This refined schema provides a more comprehensive and nuanced structure for representing LLM responses, addressing uncertainty more effectively and offering alternative perspectives when appropriate. It’s designed for clarity, flexibility, and machine readability, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

Refactor this draft schema to be consistent with openAI compatible LLM JSOn schema, but adding in additional variables as necessary and also using consistent variable names for the same things like text input and responses

> **Key Changes for OpenAI Compatibility and Consistency:**
> - **`messages` Array:** Replaces the single `query` field with a `messages` array, consistent with OpenAI’s chat completion format. This allows for multi-turn conversations and system-level instructions. Each message has a `role` (system, user, assistant) and `content`.
> - **Consistent Naming:** Uses `content` consistently for text fields in both messages and responses.
> - **OpenAI Usage Data:** Added a `usage` object within the `response` to include token usage information, mirroring OpenAI’s format. This is useful for tracking and managing costs.
> - **Removed `context`:** Context is now implicitly provided through the `messages` array, allowing for a more natural conversational flow. The system can infer context from previous messages.
> **Example (Multi-turn conversation):**
> ```json
> {
> "messages": [
> { "role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful and harmless AI assistant." },
> { "role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?" },
> { "role": "assistant", "content": "The capital of France is Paris." }
> ],
> "response": {
> "content": "Paris is also known as the City of Lights.",
> "confidence": 0.99,
> "usage": {
> "prompt_tokens": 10,
> "completion_tokens": 8,
> "total_tokens": 18
> }
> }
> }
> ```
> This revised schema is now more aligned with OpenAI’s structure while retaining the key features for optimized responses, including confidence scores, uncertainty reasoning, limitations, sources, and alternative interpretations. This makes it more practical for use with OpenAI’s APIs and facilitates integration with existing workflows. It also provides a more standardized and robust framework for developing and evaluating LLM applications.

This system:
1. Focuses on core functionality
2. Maintains clarity between formal/natural elements
3. Emphasizes truth and uncertainty
4. Provides clear execution guidance
5. Specifies required behaviors

Key aspects:
1. Information optimization
2. Uncertainty acknowledgment
3. Clear bounds
4. Truth preservation
5. Consistent handling

Would you like me to:
1. Expand any component?
2. Add specific mechanisms?
3. Clarify the execution flow?

> **Key Changes and Clarifications:**
> - **Explicit Data Flow:** The `PROCESS` now clearly defines the `INPUT` and `OUTPUT` for each stage, showing how data flows through the system.
> - **Detailed Context:** The `CONTEXT` now includes `HISTORY`, `USER_PROFILE`, and `EXTERNAL_KNOWLEDGE`.
> - **Information Assessment:** Includes `SOURCES` of information.
> - **Uncertainty Quantification:** Specifies the `TYPE` and `VALUE` of uncertainty quantification. Requires a rationale for transparency.
> - **Constraint Application:** Includes `FILTERED_RESPONSE` to show the effect of constraints.
> - **Output with Sources:** The final output now includes `SOURCES`.
> - **Weighted Scoring Adjustments:** Slightly adjusted weights and added `CONCISENESS`.
> - **More Descriptive Actions:** Uses more descriptive action names in the `PROCESS` stages.
> This revised version provides a much clearer execution flow and incorporates specific mechanisms for handling uncertainty and knowledge bounds. It’s a more concrete and actionable algorithm that can be used as a blueprint for implementing an LLM response optimization system. Next steps could involve refining the `REQUIREMENTS` and `EXECUTE` sections to align with these changes and adding concrete examples of how the system would handle specific queries.
