# Universal LLM Function Specification

```
Function: process_and_respond

Input: text string (user query/request)
Output: text string (formatted response)

Purpose: Transform input text into structured, prioritized response
         while handling constraints and maintaining reliability

Pseudo-implementation:

function process_and_respond(input_text):
    # 1. Process Input
    # Extract core query/intent from input text
    # No assumptions about processing method
    
    # 2. Structure Response
    response = concat(
        # Priority Block 1: Essential (Must complete)
        format(
            "Input understood: " + summarize(input_text)
            + "\n\n"
            + get_critical_information()
            + "\nEND_ESSENTIAL\n\n"
        ),
        
        # Priority Block 2: Important (Should complete)
        format(
            get_important_details()
            + "\nEND_IMPORTANT\n\n"
        ),
        
        # Priority Block 3: Additional (May complete)
        format(
            get_additional_context()
            + "\nEND_ADDITIONAL"
        )
    )
    
    return response

Where:
- format(): Applies consistent structure
- concat(): Joins text blocks
- summarize(): Extracts core meaning
- get_critical_information(): Highest priority content
- get_important_details(): Supporting content
- get_additional_context(): Optional content

Structure:
Each block contains complete thoughts that provide value
even if subsequent blocks are truncated

Priority:
1. Core understanding and essential response
2. Supporting information and context
3. Additional details and next steps

Completion Markers:
- END_ESSENTIAL
- END_IMPORTANT
- END_ADDITIONAL

Implementation Notes:
1. Assume minimal feature set
2. No specific language features required
3. No external dependencies assumed
4. Handles truncation gracefully
5. Works with statistical text completion
```

Key Properties:

1. Input Handling:
- Accepts any text input
- No format assumptions
- No preprocessing requirements

2. Output Generation:
- Prioritized structure
- Clear section markers
- Complete thoughts
- Natural completion points

3. Error Handling:
- Graceful degradation
- Value preservation
- Clear boundaries
- Recovery points

4. Content Priority:
```
Priority 1 (Must):
- Understanding confirmation
- Core response
- Essential information

Priority 2 (Should):
- Supporting details
- Key examples
- Context

Priority 3 (May):
- Additional information
- Next steps
- Further exploration
```

5. Implementation Independence:
- No language assumptions
- No library dependencies
- No special features required
- Minimal implementation needs

Usage Example:
```
Input: "Explain quantum computing"

Output:
Input understood: Request for quantum computing explanation
