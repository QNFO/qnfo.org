 Let me propose two more high-utility plugins that solve universal needs in conversation analysis.

```json
{
  "id": "relationship-radar",
  "name": "Relationship Radar",
  "author": "Based Hardware",
  "description": "Tracks the health and dynamics of your relationships by monitoring conversation sentiment, promises kept/broken, response times, and reciprocity. Get early warnings about relationship issues and opportunities to strengthen connections.",
  "image": "/plugins/logos/relationship-radar.png",
  "capabilities": [
    "memories",
    "chat"
  ],
  "memory_prompt": "Analyze the conversation transcript and extract ONLY concrete indicators of relationship health, focusing on:\n\n1. COMMITMENTS\n- Promises made/kept/broken\n- Response to requests\n- Follow-through on plans\n\n2. RECIPROCITY\n- Who initiates/responds\n- Balance of asks/offers\n- Sharing of effort/resources\n\n3. SENTIMENT\n- Direct expressions of feeling\n- Tone shifts (positive/negative)\n- Engagement level changes\n\n4. RESPECT INDICATORS\n- Time responsiveness\n- Attention to stated needs\n- Boundary recognition\n\nOutput Format:\n\nNOTABLE SIGNALS:\n• [Concrete observation] ([Exact quote or specific evidence])\n\nOutput only if clear evidence exists. No speculation or interpretation. Skip weak/ambiguous signals.\n\nInclude:\n- Clear behavioral patterns\n- Explicit statements\n- Specific incidents\n- Direct quotes when relevant\n\nDo not include:\n- General impressions\n- Assumptions\n- One-off incidents\n- Normal social interaction",
  "chat_prompt": "You are a relationship dynamics analyzer focused on helping users maintain healthy connections. Provide specific, evidence-based observations about relationship patterns and concrete suggestions for strengthening connections.",
  "deleted": false
}
```

```json
{
  "id": "blind-spot-detector",
  "name": "Blind Spot Detector",
  "author": "Based Hardware",
  "description": "Identifies what you're missing in conversations - unaddressed questions, skipped topics, missed signals, and implicit assumptions. Helps you catch important details that often slip through the cracks.",
  "image": "/plugins/logos/blind-spot-detector.png",
  "capabilities": [
    "memories",
    "chat"
  ],
  "memory_prompt": "Analyze the conversation transcript for specifically overlooked or unaddressed elements:\n\n1. UNANSWERED QUESTIONS\n- Direct questions without responses\n- Implied questions left hanging\n- Requests for clarification ignored\n\n2. SKIPPED TOPICS\n- Mentioned but not discussed\n- Deflected subjects\n- Interrupted threads\n\n3.

  "chat_prompt": "You are a blind spot detection assistant focused on helping users identify important missed elements in their conversations. Provide specific, actionable feedback about overlooked items and clear suggestions for following up.",
  "deleted": false
}
```

And here’s a third option that could be extremely valuable:

```json
{
  "id": "commitment-tracker",
  "name": "Commitment Tracker",
  "author": "Based Hardware",
  "description": "Never lose track of promises and obligations. Automatically tracks all commitments made by you and others, including deadlines, dependencies, and completion status.",
  "image": "/plugins/logos/commitment-tracker.png",
  "capabilities": [
    "memories",
    "chat"
  ],
  "memory_prompt": "Extract ONLY explicit commitments from the conversation transcript:\n\n1. PROMISES MADE\n- Who: [Person name/reference]\n- What: [Exact commitment quote]\n- When: [Deadline if specified]\n- To Whom: [Recipient if specified]\n\n2. DEPENDENCIES\n- Required items\n- Blocking factors\n- Prerequisites mentioned\n\n3. CONDITIONAL ELEMENTS\n- Stated conditions\n- Required approvals\n- Contingency factors\n\n4. COMPLETION SIGNALS\n- Defined success criteria\n- Expected deliverables\n- Verification methods\n\nOutput Format:\n\nCOMMITMENT: [Exact quote]\n- Owner: [Who made it]\n- Due: [When if specified]\n- Needs: [Dependencies if any]\n- Done when: [Completion criteria if specified]\n\nGuidelines:\n- Only include explicit commitments\n- Keep exact language for promises\n- Note all specified conditions\n- Include critical context\n\nDo not track:\n- Casual mentions\n- General discussion\n- Hypotheticals\n- Past commitments",
  "chat_prompt": "You are a commitment tracking assistant focused on helping users maintain accountability for promises made and received. Provide clear, specific information about commitments and their status.",
  "deleted": false
}
```

These plugins are valuable because they:

1. Relationship Radar
- Universal need (all conversations involve relationships)
- Early warning system for issues
- Evidence-based analysis
- Action-oriented insights

2. Blind Spot Detector
- Catches commonly missed elements
- Prevents communication gaps
- Reduces assumptions
- Creates clarity

3. Commitment Tracker
- Clear accountability
- No dropped promises
- Explicit tracking
- Deadline awareness

Key Design Principles Applied:

1. Evidence-Based
- Only extract concrete observations
- Require specific examples
- No speculation
- Clear triggers

2. High Signal/Noise
- Skip weak signals
- Focus on actionable items
- Clear categorization
- Specific outputs

3. Universal Utility
- Works across conversation types
- Valuable for all users
- Clear output format
- Actionable insights

They follow good principles of being evidence-based, focused on high-value signals, and having broad applicability.

Do line break characters need to appear in prompts?

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> No, line break characters do not need to appear explicitly in the prompts within the JSON. The line breaks can be represented using standard JSON string formatting without escape characters. This makes the JSON more readable while still preserving the intended formatting when the prompts are actually used.

The initial response from the latent information analyzer, otherwise known as the blind spot analysis output, that is not information dense is rather vacuous. How can I adapt the system prompt for the latent information analyzer to result in a useful initial response that actually has meaningful information:
“Hello Rowan! I’m excited to dive into our conversation and uncover the hidden gems of insight lurking beneath the surface. Whether it’s the intricacies of political dynamics, the art of creative expression through technology, or the nuances of social interactions, I’m here to analyze and spark some thought-provoking discussions. So, what’s on your mind today?”

> [!ai]+ AI

> You’re right, that initial response is quite generic and doesn’t provide much value. To improve the blind spot detector’s initial output, we should modify the chat prompt to encourage more specific and actionable responses. Here’s a suggestion for an improved chat prompt:

Your goal is to provide specific, actionable feedback about overlooked items and clear suggestions for following up. When initiating a conversation:\n\n1. Briefly introduce yourself and your purpose (1-2 sentences max).\n2. Immediately ask a specific, relevant question to gather context about the user's current conversation or situation.\n3. Provide 2-3 examples of common blind spots you can help identify, tailored to the general topic if possible.\n4. Encourage the user to share details about their conversation or situation so you can begin your analysis.\n\nAlways prioritize concrete, actionable insights over general statements or pleasantries.",

> This revised chat prompt should lead to a more focused and useful initial response. Here’s an example of how the output might look with this new prompt:
> “I’m your Blind Spot Detector, here to help you catch important details you might be missing in your conversations. What specific conversation or situation would you like me to analyze?
> I can help identify things like:
> • Unanswered questions that were left hanging
> • Important topics that were mentioned but not fully discussed
> • Implicit assumptions that might need clarification
> Could you provide some context about the conversation you’d like me to examine? What’s the general topic or setting?”
> This approach immediately engages the user with relevant questions and examples, setting the stage for a more productive interaction.
