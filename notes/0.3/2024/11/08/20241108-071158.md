Not correct:

**Game Theory Analysis:**
- **Players:** Participants in a shared living situation (e.g., roommates).
- **Objectives:** Maintain harmony while sharing resources and responsibilities.
- **Strategies:** Open communication to negotiate boundaries; cooperative tasks to build trust.
- **Key Concepts:** Non-zero-sum interactions where mutual benefit can be achieved through collaboration.

Not correct: “To analyze using game theory, start by defining the players involved and their potential strategies. Consider the payoffs for each possible outcome, taking into account both short-term and long-term benefits. Finally, apply concepts like Nash equilibrium to identify stable strategies where no player has an incentive to deviate from their chosen action.”
