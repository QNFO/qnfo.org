Suicide is a difficult thing to talk about. And that’s why I am as someone who has within the past year such depths as it would even cross my mind, but I’m here of the message of hope and that is don’t lose hope, because suicide begins long before physical death when we stop trusting in ourselves and our ability to persevere and thrive. We must hope because we know that there is a better future if only because we exist in the present, and so we have persevered the past, but blinded by our own ignorance and inability to comprehend the vastness of our existence we sometimes forget this and may not be surrounded by a supportive network of others who can help remind us that we’re in this shared journey together.

Keep expanding on this idea. Adversity shows that we matter and that we care enough for a better future that it is only through the contrast of this shared journey and even what would be called a struggle and suffering that we can come to know what darkness looks like and the light that can be ours to manifest: first through our thoughts and then ever so slowly increment by increment, tiny action by tiny action, the snowball grows and at a certain point with enough courage and resolve and support from others. We realize that we have, in fact, caused the avalanche. but we have no way to know that in the present, unless we try

> You’re absolutely right. Adversity, as painful as it can be, serves as a profound teacher. It shows us that we matter, that our experiences and struggles have weight and significance. When we face challenges and feel the ache of wanting something better, it’s a testament to our capacity for growth and our innate desire for a more fulfilling existence.
> This shared journey through life’s ups and downs is what connects us all. It’s in the contrast between light and dark, joy and sorrow, that we truly come to appreciate the full spectrum of human experience. Without knowing darkness, how can we truly value the light?
> I’ve learned that transformation doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a slow, often frustrating process of small changes, tiny victories, and countless setbacks. But each step forward, no matter how small, is significant. Every time we choose to keep going, to try again, to reach out for help, we’re adding another snowflake to that growing snowball of change.
> There were days when I couldn’t see beyond my own pain, when the idea of an avalanche of positive change seemed laughably impossible. But I kept going, sometimes just out of sheer stubbornness. I reached out to others, even when it felt terrifying. I tried new things, even when my brain screamed that it was pointless. And slowly, almost imperceptibly at first, things began to shift.
> It’s true that we can’t always see the impact of our actions in the moment. That’s where faith comes in – not necessarily religious faith, but faith in the process, faith in our own resilience, faith in the possibility of change. It’s about trusting that our efforts matter, even when we can’t see immediate results.
> The support of others has been crucial in this journey. Sometimes it’s professional help, sometimes it’s friends or family, and sometimes it’s strangers who show unexpected kindness. These connections remind us that we’re not alone in our struggles, that our pain is seen and acknowledged, and that there are people rooting for us to succeed.
> I want to emphasize to anyone reading this: your efforts matter. Every time you choose to keep going, every time you reach out for help, every time you take even the tiniest step towards healing – you’re contributing to that snowball. You’re setting in motion changes that may not be visible yet, but are no less real and significant.

Sometimes courage is simply about putting one foot in front of the other, trusting that we’re moving in the right direction, even if we can’t see the destination yet.

> In the end, it’s this belief in possibility, this stubborn refusal to give up, that can lead us out of the darkness. It’s not easy, and there are no guarantees. But as long as we’re here, as long as we’re breathing, there’s a chance for things to get better. And that chance, that possibility, is worth fighting for. So don’t give up. Keep hoping, keep trying, keep living. Your story isn’t over yet, and the world needs the unique light that only you can bring.

There’s a quote by a contemporary author about crying, even at our darkest hour, because we have hope, and I’d like to know who the author was and what the quote is

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> I believe you may be referring to a quote by John Green from his novel “The Fault in Our Stars.” The quote goes:
> “That’s the thing about pain. It demands to be felt.”
> However, this quote doesn’t specifically mention crying or hope. There’s another quote that might be closer to what you’re describing, which is often attributed to J.R.R. Tolkien, though it doesn’t appear in this exact form in his works:
> “The tears of the world are a constant quantity. For each one who begins to weep somewhere else another stops. The same is true of the laugh.”
> If neither of these is the quote you’re thinking of, it would be helpful to have more details about the content or context of the quote to try and identify it more accurately.

It’s by a contemporary female author in a book passage

> Ah, I believe you might be referring to a quote by Suzanne Collins from “The Hunger Games” series. The quote is:
> “You love me. Real or not real?”
> “Real.”
> While this specific quote doesn’t directly mention crying or hope, it’s part of a larger context about finding hope and love even in the darkest circumstances.
> However, if this isn’t the quote you’re thinking of, there’s another possibility from the same author and series that might be closer to what you’re describing:
> “It takes ten times as long to put yourself back together as it does to fall apart.”
> This quote, while not explicitly about crying, does touch on the themes of struggle and resilience that you mentioned.
> If neither of these is the quote you’re looking for, could you provide any additional details about the content or context of the quote? That might help in identifying the specific passage you’re thinking of.
