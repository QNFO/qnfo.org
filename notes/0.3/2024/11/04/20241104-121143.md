After technology failed me yet again on moped ride, south of San Francisco bye, failing to give me but necessary navigation directions that left me yet again on an interstate highway. That was about 14 lanes wide or so when I should have been on local roads, it occurred to me that I don't need to keep using technology as a crutch that I actually do know everything I need to know. I live arrested by life after figuring out with the benefit of my in select in education and AI most recently about the informational layer that supersedes our physical universe. Having cracked that key question of science, I'm good, I can figure it out. In particular, I realize that I just paid attention and look at the signs specifically road signs, having been a transportation planner. I knew it perfectly well. The designations that will help me get to my destination safely. I don't need Electronic technology, when analog technology is literally right there in huge letters above me and I assure you a lot of thought was put into what those signs were and what they would say, that's technology I'm okay with it's not going to fail when I need it most.
