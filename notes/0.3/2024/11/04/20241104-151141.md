Is a statement against our misguided notion of privacy? I'm choosing that I will. To figure out a system whereby I can release, it's all of my personally, identifying information and records publicly for everyone to see, preferably in near real-time, because all that information Is being bought and sold anyway for my tax records and even the Chinese government managed to hack into the office of personnel management database that I entered very sensitive information for to get a federal job. We've got it all wrong. What Manders is user sovereignty and I assure you, I've given my full consent and permission. For any records that I release to be used as widely as possible. Go right ahead. My only concerns are those specific identifiers that could be used with a good degree of social engineering. Mind you and considerable hacking skills like that. A man in the middle attacks for 2 factor authentication at this point. Those would be the only specific identifiers. The records don't matter. You wanna see how much is in my bank account and what I spent it on? Go right ahead. That is also being bought and sold in near real-time. But I would like that to be a discussion about control, and the user gets to decide Not the buyers and the sellers. The data brokers, like my former employer Epsilon.
