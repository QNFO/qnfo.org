An email client and server doesn’t make us sift through all we get that uses an LLM to weed through everything and suppress all but the most important emails so we can actually do things with our day instead of living our inboxes, and that’s going to be different for everyone. It’s different for me. And different than say a lawyer, but it’s about getting things done and giving us the runway and nudges to do so actually translating our human intention into machine action that pervert motes a virtuous feedback cycle

> It sounds like you’re describing an ideal email management system that uses artificial intelligence, specifically large language models (LLMs), to intelligently filter and prioritize emails. Here’s a summary of the key points and concepts you’ve outlined:
> 1. An AI-powered email client and server that:
> - Uses LLMs to analyze incoming emails
> - Filters out less important messages
> - Highlights and presents only the most crucial emails
> 2. The system would be personalized and adaptable:
> - Recognizing that importance varies from person to person
> - Adapting to different professions (e.g., your needs vs. a lawyer’s needs)
> 3. The goal is to enhance productivity:
> - Reducing time spent managing inboxes
> - Allowing users to focus on important tasks
> - Providing more time and mental space for meaningful work
> 4. The system would aim to:
> - Translate human intentions into machine actions
> - Create a virtuous feedback cycle
> - Provide helpful nudges and reminders
> 5. The overall purpose is to:
> - Help users actually get things done
> - Provide “runway” (time and space) for important tasks
> - Reduce the overwhelming nature of email management
> This concept combines elements of AI, natural language processing, personalization, and productivity enhancement to create a more efficient and less stressful email management experience.
