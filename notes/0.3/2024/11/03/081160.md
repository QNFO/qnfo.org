No lie @DeanPreston: living in Alamo Sq representing the TL and claiming to be a housing advocate when your family are landlords and you didn't fund the "right to counsel" that got me evicted for taking on the greed of slumlords like @yatpan

landlords.and what little respect for @SpeakerPelosi is gone, esp after reading her "I'm gonna win anyway" statement in the 300-page voter guide. But @BernieSanders wtf? Do you live in California??? And how out of context can that quote possibly be??
