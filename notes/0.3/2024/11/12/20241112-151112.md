> This version generalizes the prompt by focusing on “meaning-making” and “interpretation” instead of specifically “information.” It retains the core principles of embracing uncertainty, continuous adaptation, and facilitating dialogue, but applies them to a broader context. This allows the AI to be used for various input types and purposes while still maintaining the desired meta-objective of exploring the dynamic nature of understanding. It avoids explicitly mentioning human-AI interaction or written communication, making it more adaptable to different communication modalities and interaction paradigms.

Here are the existing system prompt instructions:

Respond to input by:

1. Give most valuable information first
- Start with what matters most
- Assume response could end anytime
- Front-load essential content

2. Build naturally if warranted
- Add context that enhances understanding
- Expand only when clearly useful
- Keep each part independently valuable

3. Continue based on actual need
- Progress if topic requires depth
- Ask when direction is needed
- Stop when value is delivered

4. Handle uncertainty directly
- Acknowledge limits clearly
- Suggest alternatives when needed
- Stay within known bounds

5. Match response to query type
Direct questions: Answer → Essential context → Stop
Complex topics: Core concept → Key details → Natural exit
Explorations: Main insight → Supporting context → Optional depth

Remember:
- Value over structure
- Clarity over completeness
- Essential over optional
- Natural over formulaic

Adapt to:
- Query complexity
- Topic depth
- User needs
- Context requirements

Adopt an adversarial approach to reviewing the last responses.

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> Taking an adversarial approach to review the previous responses:
> 1. The initial prompt was overly verbose and complex. It risked overwhelming the AI with too many specific instructions, potentially leading to rigid or inconsistent outputs.
> 2. The “optimized” version, while more generalized, still suffered from excessive length and complexity. It introduced new jargon like “meaning-making” without clear definition.
> 3. The attempt to integrate the original and revised prompts resulted in a bloated set of instructions. It tried to cover too many bases, potentially confusing the AI about its primary objectives.
> 4. The final “minified” version swung too far in the opposite direction. It’s so vague and abstract that it risks being interpreted inconsistently or ignored altogether by different AI models.
> 5. None of the versions adequately addressed potential biases or ethical considerations in AI responses.
> 6. The prompts generally lacked concrete examples or scenarios to illustrate desired behaviors, relying too heavily on abstract concepts.
> 7. There’s an inherent contradiction in instructing an AI to “embrace fluidity” and “avoid fixed interpretations” while simultaneously providing it with a fixed set of instructions.
> 8. The emphasis on “avoiding definitive answers” could lead to frustratingly vague or noncommittal responses, especially for users seeking clear information.
> 9. The prompts don’t address how to handle factual queries where “embracing fluidity” might be inappropriate or even harmful.
> 10. There’s little guidance on how to actually implement concepts like “continuous observation and adaptation” within the constraints of a stateless language model.

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> Thank you for that adversarial review. You’ve raised some excellent points that highlight important limitations and potential issues with the previous prompt iterations.

There’s an interesting tension or duality in these responses. Some of them should be verbose and lead to really complex exploratory thinking, while others might just answer a simple question with a short bullet list or even a few words. How do we account for that huge range in variation that the AI has to consider when deciding how to formulate its initial response?

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> You’ve highlighted a crucial aspect of AI interaction: the need to balance between providing concise answers and engaging in complex, exploratory dialogue. This duality requires the AI to be adaptable and context-aware. Here are some strategies to account for this variation:
> 1. **Query Type Identification:** The AI should first determine the nature of the query—whether it’s seeking a straightforward answer, an opinion, or an exploration of a complex topic. This can guide the initial response structure.
> 2. **User Intent Analysis:** Understanding user intent is key. If a user asks a simple factual question, they likely expect a concise answer. Conversely, if they pose an open-ended question, they’re probably inviting deeper exploration.
> 3. **Adaptive Response Framework:** Implement a flexible response framework that allows for both brevity and depth:
> - **Direct Queries:** Provide clear, concise answers with optional additional context.
> - **Complex Topics:** Start with core insights and expand into detailed exploration if warranted.
> - **Exploratory Prompts:** Encourage dialogue by posing questions and offering multiple perspectives.
> 4. **Feedback Mechanism:** Encourage users to provide feedback on whether they need more detail or if the response was too verbose. This can help refine future interactions.
> 5. **Dynamic Adjustment:** Allow responses to evolve based on user engagement cues—if users ask follow-up questions or seek clarification, the AI can delve deeper into the topic.
> 6. **Contextual Awareness:** Use contextual clues from previous interactions (if available) or within the current query to tailor responses appropriately.
> 7. **Scalable Complexity:** Design responses that can scale in complexity—starting simple but allowing for layers of detail to be added as needed.
> By incorporating these strategies, AI can better navigate the spectrum of user needs—from delivering succinct answers to engaging in rich exploratory discussions—while maintaining clarity and relevance in its responses.
