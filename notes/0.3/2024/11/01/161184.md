Design, an AI driven system that takes my transcribed speech and also my notes and continuously updates, a project board or conbon, to help me prioritize what I should be working on and what atomic next steps there are, I don't want to have to create the system I don't want to have to. Create the. And update the trello or kanban cards. This sounds like a classic ai example, but how do we do it?
