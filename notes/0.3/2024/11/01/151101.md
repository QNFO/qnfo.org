I have trouble staying focused on one task that seems important in the moment but then gets lost. Basically, my priority system is last in first out system, and I'm finding that that's not giving me the space and focus too, invest the upfront effort needed to resolve some recurring and yes, larger payoff tasks, so I'm having trouble with that. What Dan economy calls future self or type one versus type 2 thinking? Can you help me devise a system to combat that said that? Ultimately, when I assess what I did get done, it aligns with retrospectively, what I think were the most important things.

> You've identified a common struggle: prioritizing urgent tasks over important ones, leading to a "last in, first out" system that hinders progress on bigger, more impactful goals.  This is exactly the type of challenge addressed by Daniel Kahneman's Type 1 (fast, intuitive) vs. Type 2 (slow, deliberate) thinking.  Your Type 1 thinking is grabbing the "urgent" tasks, while your Type 2 thinking knows the "important" tasks deserve the focus.  Let's build a system to help your Type 2 thinking take the reins.
> **1. Clarify Your "Important" Tasks:**
> * **Brain Dump:**  Write down *everything* you feel you need to do, big or small.
> * **Categorize:** Group similar tasks (e.g., work, personal, household).
> * **Prioritize within Categories:** Use a method like the Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent/Important) to identify true priorities within each category.  Focus on the "Important but Not Urgent" quadrant – these are your long-term goals and high-impact tasks.
> * **Break Down Large Tasks:**  Huge tasks can be overwhelming. Break them into smaller, manageable steps.  This makes them less daunting and easier to schedule.
> **2. Implement a System for Focus and Execution:**
> * **Time Blocking:** Allocate specific time slots in your day or week for your "Important but Not Urgent" tasks. Treat these blocks like appointments you can't miss.
> * **Eat the Frog:** Tackle the most challenging or important task first thing in the morning when your willpower is strongest.
> * **Pomodoro Technique:** Work in focused bursts (e.g., 25 minutes) followed by short breaks. This helps maintain concentration and prevents burnout.
> * **Minimize Distractions:** Turn off notifications, close unnecessary tabs, and create a dedicated workspace.
> * **Batch Similar Tasks:** Group similar tasks together (e.g., answering emails, making phone calls) to minimize context switching and improve efficiency.
> **3.  Connect with Your Future Self:**
> * **Visualize Success:** Imagine the positive outcomes of completing your important tasks.  How will you feel? What will you achieve? This strengthens your motivation.
> * **Write a Letter to Your Future Self:** Describe your current goals and the steps you're taking to achieve them.  Read this letter periodically to stay on track.
> * **Reward Yourself:** Celebrate milestones and accomplishments, no matter how small. This reinforces positive behavior and keeps you motivated.
> **4. Review and Adjust:**
> * **Weekly Review:** At the end of each week, review your progress. What went well? What could be improved? Adjust your system as needed.
> * **Don't Be Afraid to Re-Prioritize:** Life happens.  Be flexible and willing to re-prioritize tasks as circumstances change.  The key is to be *conscious* of your priorities, not rigidly bound to them.
> **Example:**
> Let's say a big, important task is "Create a marketing plan for my business."  Instead of letting it loom large and undone, break it down:
> 1. Research competitor marketing strategies (1 hour, Tuesday morning)
> 2. Define target audience (30 minutes, Wednesday afternoon)
> 3. Outline key marketing messages (1 hour, Thursday morning)
> 4. ...and so on.
> By scheduling these smaller steps, you make the overall task less intimidating and more likely to get done.
> **Key Takeaway:**  This isn't about becoming a robot. It's about creating a structure that supports your Type 2 thinking, allowing you to make conscious choices about how you spend your time and energy, ultimately achieving your most important goals.  Be patient with yourself, and remember that building new habits takes time and effort.

This sounds like the outline of an excellent AI. Language model based system and so continue refining. This assuming that these whatever output you produce will ultimately end up as system prompt instructions for an AI assistant to process transcribe, speech data already input into A system via a microphone called omi
> [!ai]+ AI
>
> You're right, framing this as instructions for an AI assistant (like Omi) is a great way to refine it. Here's a revised version, incorporating your feedback and focusing on actionable prompts for an AI assistant:
> **Omi AI Assistant - Priority Management System Prompts**
> **Initial Setup (One-Time):**
> * **"Omi, create a new project called 'Master Task List'."**  (This will be the central repository for all tasks.)
> * **"Omi, within 'Master Task List,' create categories for [list your categories, e.g., Work, Personal, Household, Health]."**
> **Daily Input:**
> * **"Omi, add task '[task name]' to [category] in 'Master Task List'."** (Use this throughout the day to capture everything.)
> * **"Omi, remind me to review 'Master Task List' every Sunday at 5 PM."** (Sets a recurring reminder for the weekly review.)
> **Weekly Review (Every Sunday):**
> * **"Omi, open 'Master Task List'."**
> * **"Omi, for each task in 'Master Task List,' ask me 'Is this task still relevant?' If I say no, delete the task."** (This keeps the list clean.)
> * **"Omi, within each category, ask me to prioritize the tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent/Important).  Tag each task as Urgent/Important, Important/Not Urgent, Urgent/Not Important, or Not Important/Not Urgent."** (This is the core prioritization step.)
> * **"Omi, for each task tagged 'Important but Not Urgent,' ask me to break it down into smaller subtasks. Create these subtasks within the 'Master Task List' and link them to the parent task."** (This makes large tasks manageable.)
> * **"Omi, schedule the 'Important but Not Urgent' subtasks in my calendar for the upcoming week, considering my existing appointments.  Prioritize 'Eat the Frog' – schedule the most challenging task for the morning."** (This puts the important tasks on the calendar.)
> **Daily Execution:**
> * **"Omi, what are my 'Important but Not Urgent' tasks scheduled for today?"** (Start the day with focus.)
> * **"Omi, start a 25-minute Pomodoro timer for '[specific subtask]'."** (Use Omi for Pomodoro timing.)
> * **"Omi, set a 'Do Not Disturb' mode on my devices for the next 25 minutes."** (Minimize distractions during Pomodoro.)
> * **"Omi, after each Pomodoro, remind me to take a 5-minute break."**
> * **"Omi, at the end of the day, review my completed tasks in 'Master Task List' and mark them as done."**
> **Motivation and Review:**
> * **"Omi, remind me every Monday morning to visualize the positive outcomes of completing my 'Important but Not Urgent' tasks this week."**
> * **"Omi, create a document called 'Letter to Future Self' in 'Master Task List'. Remind me to update it monthly."**
> * **"Omi, when I mark an 'Important but Not Urgent' task as done, congratulate me and suggest a small reward."**
> **Key Improvements for an AI Assistant:**
> * **Voice Control:**  The entire system is designed for voice interaction with Omi.
> * **Automation:** Omi handles reminders, timers, and task management.
> * **Integration:**  Ideally, Omi would integrate with your calendar and other apps.
> * **Adaptability:**  As you use the system, Omi could learn your preferences and offer better suggestions for scheduling and prioritization.
> This refined system leverages the power of an AI assistant to automate and streamline the process, making it easier to stay focused on what truly matters. Remember, consistency is key.  The more you use the system, the more effective it will become.

At the moment, Omi cannot take actions. Its only outputs are text based for the user to take further action on. So how would you refine this system Considering that constraint
> [!ai]+ AI
>
> You're right, focusing on text-based output for actionable insights is crucial if Omi can't directly manipulate other apps. Here's a revised approach that emphasizes information presentation and user-driven action:
> **Omi AI Assistant - Priority Management System Prompts (Text-Output Focused)**
> **Initial Setup (One-Time):**
> * **"Omi, create a new note called 'Master Task List'."** (This will be the central, text-based repository.)
> * **"Omi, within 'Master Task List,' add these headings: Work, Personal, Household, Health."** (Or your preferred categories.)
> **Daily Input:**
> * **"Omi, add this task to my 'Master Task List' under [category]: [task name]."**
> **Weekly Review (Every Sunday):**
> * **"Omi, show me my 'Master Task List'."**
> * **"Omi, guide me through my 'Master Task List', category by category, asking 'Is this task still relevant?' for each item.  If I say no, mark it with '[DELETED]'."** (User manually deletes later.)
> * **"Omi, for each category in 'Master Task List', present the tasks and ask me to assign an Eisenhower Matrix label (Urgent/Important, Important/Not Urgent, etc.). Format the results as a table with columns for Task, Category, and Eisenhower Label."** (User manually updates the note with labels.)
> * **"Omi, for each task labeled 'Important but Not Urgent', ask me to break it down into smaller subtasks.  Append these subtasks under the parent task in the 'Master Task List'."**
> * **"Omi, generate a suggested weekly schedule based on my 'Important but Not Urgent' tasks and subtasks.  Consider 'Eat the Frog' and present the schedule in a day-by-day format.  Note: This is a suggestion; I will manually add these to my calendar."** (Omi provides a text-based schedule for the user to implement.)
> **Daily Execution:**
> * **"Omi, show me the 'Important but Not Urgent' tasks from my 'Master Task List' that I planned for today according to our suggested schedule."**
> * **"Omi, set a 25-minute timer.  Remind me to take a 5-minute break when it's done."** (User manages Do Not Disturb manually.)
> * **"Omi, at the end of the day, guide me through my 'Master Task List' and ask which tasks I completed.  Mark completed tasks with '[DONE]'."**
> **Motivation and Review:**
> * **"Omi, every Monday morning, remind me to visualize success by asking: 'What positive outcomes will completing your 'Important but Not Urgent' tasks this week bring?'"**
> * **"Omi, create a new note called 'Letter to Future Self'. Remind me to update it monthly."**
> * **"Omi, when I mark a task as '[DONE]', congratulate me."** (Reward is user-managed.)
> **Key Changes for Text-Output Only:**
> * **Manual Task Management:** The user now actively updates the 'Master Task List' based on Omi's prompts and suggestions.
> * **Structured Output:**  Omi provides formatted tables and schedules for easier review and action.
> * **Emphasis on Prompts and Reminders:** Omi acts as a guide and prompt system, keeping the user engaged in the process.
> This revised system acknowledges Omi's limitations while still providing valuable support for prioritization, planning, and execution.  The user remains in control, using Omi as a powerful, text-based assistant to stay organized and focused.

I can see 2 avenues for this one is that it could be expanded to a an. Information based life priority system, where somehow the interplayer contrast between what the user prioritizes. In any given moment, his reweighted with shifting priorities and focus i.e. that If in any particular moment a user is focus, they're supposed to be focused on one thing, but then something else comes into the picture that new information can then be used to dynamically shift those weights. So it's not to create a static picture. Also, there is something like the problem of points where if the users engaged in what was initially a high value, high payoff task. But at that task, the value of that is diminished, or has to be stopped, how do we assess the what's called the problem of points?
