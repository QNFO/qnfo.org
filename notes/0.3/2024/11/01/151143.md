I wanna create a an AI assistant that helps me deal with my ADHD by suggesting next actions and helping me figure out where I am picked up last picked something up. This is related to the problem of points, and the issue is that if you have this multi step project or this game, if you will, then the payoffs change at each level or each step. And so assessing that can be challenging, especially for those of us focused only on present value. And we miss the forests from the trees or miss these high payoff, big projects because we’re just too focused on my new share that don’t really have a payoff, except in
Immediate gratification, and I’m looking for a way to overcome that with the power of AI. One outcome or 1 possibility should always be other or do something else or randomness. That’s what’s challenging is wrapping my head around. How such a the model would operate solely from text based output to drive user action to really motivate and drive user action.
