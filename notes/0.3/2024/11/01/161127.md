Two main problems consistently affect my productivity. One is that I get distracted easily. Probably due to ADHD and have a hard time distinguishing between short-term impulses and longer term, higher initial input work that will yield a bigger payoff and then the other thing is that Have a hard time doing moving between high level work, like ideation and creativity, like blue sky, thinking into more in the weeds in demort into the weeds, work like coding and paperwork, and both are essential, but it's it takes a lot of there's a high switching cost to doing that and i'm not sure how to optimize that?
