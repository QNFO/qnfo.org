# Decoding Reality

**How Information is Key to Consciousness and Our Inner World**

We often think of the universe as being made of matter and energy – stars, planets, atoms, and forces. But what if there was something even more fundamental, something that underpins it all: **information**? Not just the information on your phone or computer, but information as the very fabric of reality. This isn’t just a techy, futuristic idea; it’s a mind-bending perspective that could revolutionize how we understand everything, especially the most mysterious thing of all: **consciousness** – your inner world of feelings, thoughts, and experiences.

Imagine for a moment that everything, from the smallest particle to the grandest galaxy, is fundamentally made of information. Think of it like digital code, but on a cosmic scale. If this is true, it’s not just a cool philosophical concept; it offers us an incredibly powerful new way to explore the nature of our own subjective experience – those unique, personal sensations we call **qualia**.

## The Puzzle of Qualia: Why Does Red Feel Red?

Have you ever wondered why the color red *feels* red to you? Why does the taste of chocolate taste like *chocolate* and not, say, the sound of a trumpet? These subjective, qualitative experiences – the redness of red, the feeling of pain, the sweetness of sugar – are what philosophers call qualia. They are the raw feels of our conscious life.

The problem is, science, in its quest to understand the world objectively, has struggled to explain qualia. We can describe the physics of light reflecting off a red object, and we can map the brain activity that happens when you see red. But these objective descriptions don’t capture the *subjective* experience of *seeing red*. They don’t explain *why* it feels like anything at all, let alone *why* it feels the way it does. It’s as if there’s a gap between the physical world and our inner, felt world.

This is where the “informational universe” idea becomes so exciting. It suggests that qualia aren’t some mysterious, unexplainable add-on to reality, but rather, they **emerge** naturally from the way information is processed in complex systems – systems like our brains.

Think of it this way: the meaning of a single letter, like ‘A’, is pretty limited on its own. But when you combine it with other letters, like ‘C’, ‘T’, and ‘S’, you can create the word ‘CATS’. Suddenly, meaning emerges – the idea of a furry feline. The meaning isn’t in any single letter, but in the *relationships* between them, the pattern they form.

Similarly, the informational universe theory suggests that qualia arise from the specific *patterns* of information and the *relationships* between those patterns within our conscious awareness. It’s not just about the individual bits of information in your brain, but how they’re connected and interacting. Just like the meaning of a word emerges from its place in a sentence, the unique “feel” of your experiences emerges from the complex web of information being processed by your brain.

## Transformers, Maps, and the Shape of Experience

To understand how this information processing might work, consider the incredible advances in Artificial Intelligence, particularly with **transformer models**. You might have heard of these models powering things like advanced language translation and image generation. But their real power lies in their ability to understand and capture complex relationships and dependencies within vast amounts of data.

Imagine a transformer model trying to understand a sentence. It doesn’t just read it word by word in a linear fashion. Instead, it uses something called “self-attention.” This is a clever mechanism that allows the model to dynamically pay attention to different parts of the sentence simultaneously, figuring out which words are most relevant to each other. It’s like the model is constantly asking, “How does this word relate to *that* word? And *that* one? And how strong are these connections?”

This “self-attention” process might be a powerful analogy for how our consciousness works within an informational universe. Our awareness isn’t just a passive recipient of information. It’s actively navigating and interpreting the informational landscape, constantly establishing and weighing connections between different pieces of information flooding our senses and thoughts. Just like the transformer, our consciousness might be dynamically forming connections and focusing its “attention” to make sense of the world and create our subjective experience.

To further grasp this, let’s think about **topology**. This is a branch of mathematics that deals with the properties of shapes and spaces that stay the same even when you stretch, bend, or twist them – think of a coffee cup being topologically the same as a donut. In the context of our informational universe, topology is crucial because it’s not just about *what* information exists, but *how* that information is arranged and connected – its shape or **structure**.

Imagine the information in your brain as a vast network. Topology helps us understand the *shape* of this network – how different bits of information are connected and related to each other. This shape, this topology, is what ultimately defines the qualitative properties of your experiences. The specific way information is interwoven and structured in your brain at any given moment gives rise to the unique “feel” of your current conscious state.

## Looking Backwards to Understand: Connecting the Dots of Our Lives

Have you ever had an experience that didn’t make sense at the time, but later, looking back, you saw how it all fit together? Steve Jobs famously said, “You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards.” This simple yet profound idea highlights the **retrospective** nature of meaning-making.

Think about a complex plot in a movie. As you watch it unfold, you might be confused, surprised, or even frustrated. But at the end, when all the pieces click into place, the story takes on a new, richer meaning. You connect the dots backwards, and the initial confusion gives way to understanding.

Our conscious experience is remarkably similar. We move through time, bombarded with a constant stream of new information and sensations. It’s only in **retrospect**, as we reflect on our experiences, that we weave them into a coherent narrative, a continuous stream of qualia. The meaning and the very qualitative “feel” of our experiences are not just given to us in the moment; they emerge from the connections we forge between different pieces of information as we look back on our journey through this informational universe. Consciousness is, in a way, an ongoing act of interpretation, a continuous process of “connecting the dots” after they’ve already appeared.

## Mapping Our Inner Universe: Graph Theory and the Nodes of Existence

To further visualize this informational universe and our place within it, we can turn to **graph theory**. This is a branch of mathematics that deals with networks – think of social networks online or transportation networks in a city. Graph theory uses nodes (points) and edges (connections between points) to represent these networks.

Imagine the informational universe as a gigantic graph. Each **node** in this graph can represent a piece of information – it could be a physical thing like a place, a person, or an object. But it could also be something abstract, like an emotion, an idea, a memory, or even a concept like “justice” or “beauty.” The **edges** connecting these nodes represent the relationships between these pieces of information – how they interact, influence, and relate to each other.

Your life, then, can be seen as a journey through this vast informational graph. You are constantly traversing from node to node, encountering new information, making connections, and drawing inferences along the way. You move from experiencing one thing to another, from one thought to the next, constantly building and refining your map of the informational world.

And here’s the truly mind-blowing part: the **meaning** you derive from this journey, the understanding you gain, the qualitative experiences you have – all of this is essentially *inferred by you*. You are the active meaning-maker in your own informational universe. Even shared meanings, like our understanding of relationships, societal structures, or huge existential concepts like life and death, are ultimately constructed collectively by us, through our shared journey through this informational web. We agree upon and reinforce certain connections and interpretations, creating a shared reality built on information.

## Rewriting Reality: Not a Fixed Past, But an Unfolding Future

This informational universe model isn’t just a new way to think about consciousness; it also challenges some deeply ingrained ideas about time and reality. One such idea is the **block universe** theory, which proposes that the past, present, and future all exist simultaneously, frozen in a four-dimensional block of spacetime. In this view, everything is predetermined, and free will is just an illusion.

But the informational universe model paints a radically different picture. It suggests that reality isn’t fixed and predetermined. Instead, it is **dynamic and constantly unfolding**. The future isn’t already written; it’s being written in the present, moment by moment, with each interaction and each exchange of information. Think of it like a constantly evolving story, not a pre-printed book.

Imagine the universe being updated at the most fundamental level, at incredibly tiny intervals of time known as the **Planck constant**. At each of these moments, every interaction, every quantum event, is like adding a new word to the story of the universe, shaping what happens next.

This dynamic view has profound implications for our understanding of **free will and agency**. If reality is constantly being created and shaped by information exchange, then we are not just passive observers in a pre-set world. We are **active participants** in its ongoing creation. Our choices, actions, and even our interpretations of information – how we “connect the dots” – actually influence and shape the informational landscape, contributing to the unfolding of the universe itself. This is a hugely empowering idea, suggesting that we are not simply puppets in a predetermined play, but co-authors of reality.

## The Future of Knowing: Navigating the Informational Seas

Understanding the universe as fundamentally informational opens up exciting new avenues for knowledge creation and exploration. If we recognize information as the basic building block of everything, we can start developing new tools and strategies for navigating and understanding this vast informational landscape.

This includes building **AI systems** that are not just good at processing data, but can genuinely “connect the dots” in human-like ways, making inferences, understanding context, and drawing meaningful conclusions from complex webs of information. Imagine AI that can truly assist us in understanding the intricate patterns of the informational universe, helping us unravel mysteries of consciousness, the cosmos, and everything in between.

Furthermore, this framework pushes us to deepen our understanding of **how our own consciousness interacts with information**. How do we create and share knowledge? How can we become more effective navigators of the informational seas we swim in? And how can we use this knowledge to shape not just our own lives, but a more meaningful and fulfilling future for all?

## A Universe of Connections

The informational universe isn’t just a fascinating theory; it’s a powerful new lens through which to view reality, consciousness, and our place in the cosmos. By embracing this framework, we begin to see the universe not as a collection of inert stuff, but as a dynamic, interconnected web of information, constantly processing, evolving, and creating itself.

This perspective invites us to unlock new frontiers in knowledge, to explore the depths of our own consciousness, and to understand the dynamic unfolding of reality in ways we never thought possible. It suggests that the universe, at its heart, is not just matter and energy, but a vast, interconnected story being written in information – and that we, as conscious beings, are not just characters in this story, but active participants in its ongoing creation. And that, in itself, is a truly mind-expanding thought.
