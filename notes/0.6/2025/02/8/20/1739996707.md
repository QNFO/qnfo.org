These values represent our best understanding of the universe, yet they come with significant uncertainties. Physicists often introduce these parameters to make models work, rather than truly reflecting the underlying reality. This practice raises critical questions about the reliability of our scientific methods and the extent to which we should trust these models.

In my first professional job, I had the opportunity to work with computer simulation models. One of the old timers who had programmed the models had a peculiar habit of embedding inexplicable coefficients and constants directly into the code. When asked about these mysterious values, he would invariably respond, “To make the model work.”

> Rather than figure out how to model reality accurately it was easier just to make the math work. We even had a name for these: **fudge factors**

Except, that’s not how it’s supposed to go. These values are not about just fudging the math to make the model work; they are about making a model of reality that aligns with our understanding. Instead, they add unnecessary complexity and navel-gazing.

Einstein’s most famous equation, $E = mc^2$, is perhaps the most iconic in history. Yet, physicists often fail to consider momentum, leading to the false assertion that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. This oversight calls into question the empirical standards we place on mathematics. The idea that the universe runs on math alone is absurd. Our number system is a hodgepodge of different ideas and contradictory constructs, and surely the universe has more sense than that.

Einstein’s equations famously included the cosmological constant (Λ), a fudge factor he initially introduced to maintain a static universe. However, after Edwin Hubble’s discovery that the universe is expanding—a revelation confirmed by what we now call the Hubble constant (H₀)—Einstein abandoned the cosmological constant, calling it his “biggest blunder.” Ironically, modern cosmology has resurrected Λ to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe, swapping one fudge factor for another. Even Einstein stopped using the cosmological constant—except when he didn’t, and neither did the universe. The Hubble constant itself has become a source of tension, with discrepancies in its measured value challenging our understanding of cosmic evolution.

Moreover, we pour billions of dollars into projects like the Large Hadron Collider, chasing after theories like string theory, multiverses, or many-worlds interpretations. These theories are speculative and untestable, leading us down a path of fantasy rather than science. How do you test the multiverse? How do you falsify that it doesn’t exist? We are lost in a maze of our own making, blinded by the glittering promise of a theory of everything that may never come.

Billions of dollars chasing shadows and phantoms, while the real problems of the world go unsolved. We are lost in a maze of our own making, blinded by the glittering promise of a theory of everything that may never come. It’s time for physicists to be humbled by the realization that they’re wrong—that physics is not the pinnacle of science they often believe it to be. So, get out of their offices, walk around campus, and go talk to the philosophy department. Or better yet, use that gray matter to think critically about everything they think they know. In doing so, they might just find some surprising revelations inside their own heads—truths that were there all along, waiting to be rediscovered.
