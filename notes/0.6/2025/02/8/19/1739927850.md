Frame in terms of questions and answers within a johari window, for example: undisputably true facts (known knowns); questionable assumptions or conventional wisdom that may not be true (known knowns); inferences derived from what is known (known unknowns); and outstanding questions for which more information is needed (unknown unknowns)

Framing the Findings within a Johari Window
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the findings on emergent spacetime from entanglement, framed within a Johari Window:
1. Undisputably True Facts (Known Knowns)
 - Entanglement is a fundamental phenomenon in quantum mechanics.
 - General relativity and quantum mechanics are currently incompatible.
 - Tensor networks are a mathematical tool for representing quantum systems.
 - The holographic principle suggests that information about a region of space is encoded on its boundary.
 - The AdS/CFT correspondence relates a theory of gravity to a quantum field theory without gravity.
2. Questionable Assumptions or Conventional Wisdom (Known Knowns)
 - Spacetime is a smooth, continuous fabric.
 - Gravity is a fundamental force.
 - The universe is fundamentally classical in nature.
3. Inferences Derived from What is Known (Known Unknowns)
 - Entanglement may be the foundation of spacetime.
 - Gravity may be a function of information density.
 - The universe may be a holographic projection from a lower-dimensional reality.
 - Black holes may be connected to distant regions of spacetime through wormholes.
4. Outstanding Questions (Unknown Unknowns)
 - What is the precise mechanism by which entanglement gives rise to spacetime?
 - How does the information density determine the strength of gravity?
 - What are the implications of emergent spacetime for cosmology and black hole physics?
 - Can we experimentally verify the emergence of spacetime from entanglement?
 - How does this new understanding of spacetime affect our understanding of the nature of reality?
