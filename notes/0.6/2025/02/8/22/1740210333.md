Shumann resonance and Akashik record

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> The Schumann resonances and the Akashic records are two distinct concepts, each from different fields of study and belief systems.
> ### Schumann Resonances
> 1. **Definition**: Schumann resonances refer to a set of spectrum peaks in the extremely low frequency (ELF) portion of the Earth’s electromagnetic field spectrum. They are global electromagnetic resonances, generated and excited by lightning discharges in the cavity formed by the Earth’s surface and the ionosphere.
> 2. **Frequency**: The fundamental frequency of these resonances is approximately 7.83 Hz, with several higher harmonics.
> 3. **Scientific Relevance**: These resonances are used in various scientific studies, including monitoring global lightning activity, studying the properties of the ionosphere, and even investigating potential impacts on human health and behavior.
> 4. **Applications**: Research into Schumann resonances can provide insights into climate change, weather patterns, and other atmospheric phenomena.
> ### Akashic Records
> 1. **Definition**: The Akashic records are a concept from spiritual traditions that describe a compendium of all universal events, thoughts, words, emotions, and intent ever to have occurred in the past, present, or future. This is believed to be encoded in a non-physical plane of existence known as the etheric plane.
> 2. **Origins**: The term “Akasha” comes from a Sanskrit word meaning “ether” or “sky.” The concept has roots in various religious traditions such as Hinduism and Theosophy.
> 3. **Purpose**: Many believe that accessing these records can provide spiritual guidance, insight into one’s life purpose or past lives, and help with personal growth.
> 4. **Accessing the Records**: It is said that certain individuals can access these records through meditation or other spiritual practices to gain insight into their own lives or those of others.
> ### Comparison
> - **Nature**: Schumann resonances are scientifically measurable phenomena related to Earth’s electromagnetic environment; Akashic records are metaphysical concepts not scientifically proven.
> - **Field**: Schumann resonances belong to geophysics and atmospheric science; Akashic records belong to spirituality and metaphysical studies.
> - **Evidence**: There is empirical evidence for Schumann resonances through scientific measurement; Akashic records rely on personal belief systems without empirical evidence.
> While both concepts deal with energy fields in some form (electromagnetic for Schumann resonances and spiritual/etheric for Akashic records), they operate within entirely different frameworks—one scientific and one metaphysical/spiritual.

that’s something we can perceive again what does what does that what does 7.83 HZ say about the the width of that that frequency and and its ability to say travel through matter and Earth etc long distances

> The fundamental frequency of the Schumann resonances, approximately 7.83 Hz, is in the extremely low frequency (ELF) range of the electromagnetic spectrum. This low frequency has several implications for its propagation characteristics:
> 1. **Wavelength and Propagation**: The wavelength associated with a frequency of 7.83 Hz is quite long, on the order of tens of thousands of kilometers. This allows the waves to propagate around the Earth multiple times with minimal attenuation, as they are confined within the cavity formed by the Earth’s surface and the ionosphere.
> 2. **Penetration through Matter**: ELF waves can penetrate through various materials, including water and soil, more effectively than higher-frequency electromagnetic waves. This characteristic makes them useful for communication with submarines and in geophysical exploration.
> 3. **Global Reach**: Due to their ability to travel long distances with little loss of energy, Schumann resonances can be detected globally. This makes them valuable for monitoring global lightning activity and studying atmospheric phenomena.
> 4. **Interaction with Biological Systems**: There is ongoing research into how ELF frequencies, including those of Schumann resonances, might interact with biological systems. Some studies suggest potential impacts on human health and behavior, although this area remains a topic of scientific investigation.
> Overall, the low frequency and long wavelength of Schumann resonances enable them to travel efficiently over great distances within Earth’s atmospheric cavity, making them a unique natural phenomenon with various scientific applications.
