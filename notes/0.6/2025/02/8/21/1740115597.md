I hope this message finds you well. My name is Rowan Brad Quni, and I am deeply passionate about leveraging my expertise in AI knowledge synthesis to create a better world. I am excited to introduce Amsa (AI 411), a non-commercial initiative that aligns closely with NECTEC’s strategic goals, particularly in empowering disadvantaged communities through knowledge learning.

Personal Vision:

My vision is rooted in the belief that technology, when harnessed ethically and responsibly, can be a powerful force for good. With a background in data analytics and program management from esteemed organizations like Deloitte and the U.S. Federal Government, I have dedicated my career to developing and implementing AI-driven solutions that address pressing global challenges. This is not just a professional endeavor; it is a personal mission to create a more equitable and sustainable future for all.

About Amma (AI 411):

Amsa is an initiative committed to providing secure, transparent, and universally accessible information services via SMS. Our mission is to ensure that everyone, regardless of their location or economic status, can benefit from AI-driven insights. By utilizing advanced language models and blockchain for data security and integrity, Amsa delivers personalized information in multiple languages directly to users’ mobile phones. The goal is to empower communities by making information a tool for development and safety.

**Alignment with NECTEC’s Strategic Goals:**

Self-Learning Service Platform

Amsa’s platform supports self-learning by offering educational resources tailored to individual needs. Through our advanced language models, we can provide customized learning materials that adapt to each user’s progress and preferences. This ensures that learners in disadvantaged areas receive high-quality education that is both relevant and engaging. It is my vision to see every child, regardless of their circumstances, have access to the tools they need to succeed.

Applications for STEM

Amsa can be integrated into STEM education initiatives, providing students with interactive and dynamic learning experiences. Amsa can deliver real-time feedback, solve complex problems, and offer simulations that enhance understanding of scientific concepts. This empowers students to explore STEM subjects in a more intuitive and effective manner. By fostering a love for science and technology, we can pave the way for a generation of innovators who will drive positive change.

I am currently in discussions with a European agency dedicated to advancing AI, and I believe that the same principles and priorities could apply to NECTEC. Together, we can leverage our collective expertise to produce the most good possible. This is not just about creating a product or service; it is about building a foundation for a better world.

I believe that Amsa’s capabilities align perfectly with NECTEC’s vision for disadvantaged knowledge learning. By working together, we can create transformative solutions that empower communities and drive positive change. I would be delighted to discuss potential collaborations and explore how Amsa can contribute to NECTEC’s initiatives.

Thank you for considering this opportunity. I look forward to the possibility of partnering with NECTEC and making a meaningful impact together.

Best regards,

RBQ
