Research Plan: Bridging Artificial and Biological Neural Networks for Mutual Advancement
Title: Comparative Research Plan: Bridging Artificial and Biological Neural Networks for Mutual Advancement
Overarching Goal: To investigate the breadth and depth of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Biological Neural Networks (BNNs) through rigorous comparative analysis, leveraging the strengths of each to advance our understanding of intelligence, computation, and learning in both artificial and biological systems. This research aims to foster a symbiotic relationship between ANN and BNN research, leading to mutual breakthroughs and innovative applications.
Core Research Questions:
 - Architectural Commonalities and Divergences: What are the fundamental similarities and differences in the organizational principles, connectivity patterns, and modularity of ANNs and BNNs across different scales (synaptic, neuronal, circuit, system)? How do these architectural features impact computational capabilities and efficiency?
 - Learning and Plasticity Mechanisms: How do ANNs and BNNs learn and adapt? What are the analogous and distinct mechanisms of plasticity, learning rules, and optimization strategies employed? Can biological learning principles inspire more robust and efficient ANN learning algorithms?
 - Information Representation and Coding: How is information encoded, represented, and transformed in ANNs and BNNs? What are the similarities and differences in the types of representations learned (e.g., distributed, sparse, compositional)? Can we leverage biological principles of representation to improve the interpretability and generalization of ANNs?
 - Efficiency and Robustness Trade-offs: How do ANNs and BNNs compare in terms of energy efficiency, computational efficiency, and robustness to noise, damage, and adversarial attacks? What biological strategies contribute to BNNsâ€™ remarkable efficiency and robustness, and can these be translated to ANNs?
 - Higher-Level Cognition and Behavior: To what extent can current ANNs model complex cognitive functions and behaviors observed in BNNs (e.g., habit formation, decision-making, reasoning, consciousness)? Where do current ANNs fall short, and what biological insights can guide the development of more sophisticated AI models capable of human-level intelligence?
 - Symbiotic Applications and Translation: How can insights gained from ANNs enhance our understanding of BNN function and dysfunction (e.g., neurological disorders)? Conversely, how can biological principles inspire the development of novel and more beneficial AI technologies (e.g., brain-computer interfaces, neuromorphic computing, AI for personalized healthcare)?
