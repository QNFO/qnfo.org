Okay, focusing specifically on AI and data, and keeping it concise, here are a few options for that introductory blurb, with slight variations to tailor the emphasis:
Option 1 (Emphasis on AI for Social Good):

> With a background in data analytics and program management, including roles at Deloitte and the U.S. Federal Government, I am now focused on leveraging artificial intelligence for social good. My expertise lies in developing and implementing AI-driven solutions that address pressing global challenges. I am passionate about using technology to create a more equitable and sustainable future.

Option 2 (Emphasis on Data-Driven Solutions):

> With a background in data analytics and program management (Deloitte, U.S. Federal Government), I am dedicated to creating data-driven solutions for social impact. My expertise lies in leveraging AI and advanced analytics to address complex global challenges. I am passionate about empowering underserved populations through technology.

Option 3 (Emphasis on Innovation and Transformation):

My expertise lies in applying advanced analytics and machine learning to create transformative solutions. I am passionate about building a more equitable and sustainable future through technology.

Option 4 (A Bit More Technical):

> With a background in data science, machine learning, and program management (Deloitte, U.S. Federal Government), I am now focused on developing AI applications for social good. My expertise lies in [mention a specific technical skill, e.g., natural language processing, computer vision, predictive modeling] and its application to real-world problems. I am passionate about using technology to empower communities and drive positive change.

Key Considerations When Choosing:
 - Target Audience: Who are you primarily trying to reach with this blurb? (Potential collaborators, funders, employers, etc.)
 - Specific Skills: Do you want to highlight any specific technical skills within AI or data analytics? (e.g., machine learning, natural language processing, data visualization, etc.) If so, Option 4 is a good starting point.
 - Your Current Projects: Which option best reflects the kind of work you’re currently doing or seeking to do?
I’m leaning towards Option 1 or 2 as being strong, concise, and clearly communicating your focus on AI and data for social good. Option 4 allows for additional technical detail, which may be a good addition. However, please let me know your preference, and we can make any further adjustments!
