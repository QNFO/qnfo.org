Okay, this is very helpful! Knowing that you’re actively involved in both research and building a first-generation commercial quantum processor, and that you’re looking for R&D partnerships, significantly clarifies your goals and allows us to craft a much more targeted and impactful LinkedIn summary.
Here are revised options, incorporating this new information and aiming for maximum impact within the 2600-character limit:
Option 1 (Emphasis on R&D Partnerships):

> I’m a tech entrepreneur and U.S. expat currently focused on building the first generation of commercialized quantum processors. I’m driving both research and development, with a strong emphasis on applications for global social good. My background includes research program management with the U.S. Federal Government and data analytics consulting at Deloitte, providing me with the expertise to lead complex, multi-faceted projects. I’m actively seeking R&D partnerships with tech firms and research institutions that share a commitment to pushing the boundaries of quantum computing and creating a more equitable and sustainable future. Let’s connect and explore collaborative opportunities. #QNFO

Option 2 (Emphasis on Building the Future):

> I’m a tech entrepreneur and U.S. expat building the first generation of commercial quantum processors with a focus on social impact. Currently based in Southeast Asia, I’m leading the research and development efforts within the QNFO (Quantum-enhanced Networked Framework for Ontology) initiative. My goal is to make quantum computing accessible and beneficial to all, addressing critical global challenges through innovative applications. My experience spans research program management (U.S. Federal Government) and data analytics (Deloitte). I’m actively seeking R&D partnerships to accelerate this vision. Let’s connect and discuss how we can collaborate. #QNFO

Option 3 (More Technical Detail, if appropriate):

> I’m a tech entrepreneur and U.S. expat currently based in Southeast Asia, researching and building the first generation of [mention specific type, e.g., “fault-tolerant” or “NISQ”] quantum processors. My work, through the QNFO (Quantum-enhanced Networked Framework for Ontology) initiative, focuses on developing practical applications of quantum computing for social good. Prior experience includes research program management with the U.S. Federal Government and data analytics at Deloitte. I’m actively seeking R&D partnerships with tech firms and research institutions specializing in [mention specific areas, e.g., “quantum algorithms,” “quantum materials,” or “quantum error correction”]. Let’s connect and explore potential collaborations. #QNFO

Option 4 (Combining Previous and Expanding):

> I’m a tech entrepreneur and U.S. expat dedicated to harnessing the power of quantum computing and AI for global social good. Currently based in Southeast Asia, I’m actively researching and building the first generation of commercialized quantum processors within the QNFO (Quantum-enhanced Networked Framework for Ontology) initiative, focused on creating a more equitable and sustainable future.
>
> My journey has been one of transformation, leading me from a successful career in data analytics and program management to a path deeply aligned with my values. Prior experience includes roles with the U.S. Federal Government in research program management and with Deloitte in data analytics. This background provided me with a strong foundation in complex project leadership and data-driven decision-making.
>
> I’m passionate about connecting with individuals and organizations who share a commitment to ethical technology and positive social impact, and I am actively seeking R&D partnerships with tech firms and research institutions. I believe in the power of collaboration to address the world’s most pressing challenges. Let’s connect and explore opportunities to work together. #QNFO

Key Changes and Rationale:
 - “First Generation of Commercialized Quantum Processors”: This phrase is powerful and immediately conveys the ambitious scope of your work.
 - “R&D Partnerships”: Explicitly stating this clarifies your immediate needs and target audience.
 - “Tech Firms and Research Institutions”: Specifies the types of organizations you want to connect with.
 - Optional Technical Detail (Option 3): Adding specifics about the type of quantum processor or your areas of specialization within quantum computing can attract experts in those fields. Only use this if you’re comfortable discussing these details.
 - Option 4 is an extended version that combines previous drafts.
Recommendations:
 - Choose the option that best reflects your current priorities and the level of technical detail you want to share. Option 1 is concise and impactful. Option 2 emphasizes the “building the future” aspect. Option 3 is for a more technically-minded audience. Option 4 is a longer, more complete option.
 - If possible, add a link to a website or online portfolio for QNFO (if one exists) to provide more information to interested parties.
 - Keep your “Experience” section up-to-date with relevant details about your past roles, emphasizing quantifiable achievements and skills that align with your current goals.
 - I have retained a maximum of 2600 characters in option 4.
I strongly recommend Option 1, 2, or 4, as they are all strong, concise, and impactful. Option 3 is great if you want to get very specific, but it might be too niche for a general summary. Let me know which version you prefer, and we’ll finalize your LinkedIn summary!
