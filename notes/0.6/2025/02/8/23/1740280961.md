If you wish to be understood seek first to understand I’m reminded of these words visiting a temple or Buddhist site in pi in Northern Thailand where I expected the sign to say no shorts but dressing politely also seemed to indicate that a t-shirt was not appropriate however when asking a woman selling raps as she indicated I’m in good shape so despite the economic benefit she gave me the truth.

This is a setup for thinking about our global conflicts in a more respectful light because we don’t know what we don’t know. Inexplicably I was visiting a waterfall beautiful place of natural wonder and there were a fix to a bench a pro-Israel sticker and a some kind of painted free Gaza stencil. That they were on the same bench was remarkable enough but I wondered about these tropes and memes that we fall into within the context of understanding what does that even mean what does free Gaza mean what does pro-choice mean what what do these things mean when they mean nothing at all what if we lived in a world without borders and a world where my individual choice remains my sovereignty one where do no harm means that respect for all life respects the sanctity of my life and my conscience to make that choice…. For me not others.

> **Summary:**
> The author reflects on the importance of understanding different perspectives and respecting individual choices. They use examples from a Buddhist temple and a waterfall to illustrate how preconceived notions can hinder understanding. They suggest that we should strive to live in a world without borders and where individual sovereignty is respected.
> **Key Points:**
> - **Seek understanding before being understood:** It’s essential to listen to and try to comprehend other viewpoints before expressing our own.
> - **Respect cultural norms:** Different cultures have different customs and expectations. It’s important to be mindful of these when visiting or interacting with people from other backgrounds.
> - **Question assumptions:** We often make assumptions about what others believe or mean. It’s crucial to ask questions and challenge our own biases.
> - **Avoid divisive labels:** Labels like “pro-Israel” and “free Gaza” can create divisions and hinder understanding. It’s better to focus on common ground and shared values.
> - **Respect individual choices:** Everyone has the right to make their own choices, as long as they do not harm others. We should respect the sovereignty of individuals and their right to live according to their own beliefs.
> - **Strive for a world without borders:** The author envisions a world where people can live freely without the constraints of borders or labels.
> - **Respect for all life:** The principle of “do no harm” should extend to all living beings, including ourselves. We should respect the sanctity of life and the right of individuals to make choices that align with their conscience.
