While there isn’t a formally recognized “International English” language like Esperanto, several resources and approaches promote clear and effective communication in English across diverse linguistic backgrounds. These focus on using plain language principles and avoiding overly complex grammar or vocabulary.
Here’s a breakdown of what constitutes “International English” in practice:
 - Plain Language Principles: This approach emphasizes clarity and conciseness in writing and speaking. Key elements include:
   - Simple sentence structure: Favoring straightforward sentence construction, often following a subject-verb-object order.
   - Common vocabulary: Choosing widely understood words and avoiding jargon, idioms, and overly nuanced expressions.
   - Active voice: Using active voice to make sentences more direct and easier to understand.
   - Short sentences and paragraphs: Breaking down information into manageable chunks.
 - English as a Lingua Franca (ELF): ELF describes the use of English as a common language among speakers of different first languages. ELF research highlights effective communication strategies used by multilingual speakers, such as:
   - Accommodation: Speakers adjust their language to be more easily understood by others.
   - Negotiation of meaning: Focus on ensuring mutual understanding, even if it means clarifying or rephrasing.
   - Tolerance of variation: Accepting different accents and grammatical variations as long as communication is successful.
 - Globish: Developed by Jean-Paul Nerrière, Globish is a simplified form of English based on a limited vocabulary of around 1,500 words and simplified grammar rules. It aims for practical communication and excludes idioms and complex grammatical structures. While not universally accepted, it exemplifies the idea of a functional, simplified English.
 - Basic English: Created by Charles Kay Ogden, Basic English is another simplified version of English, using a vocabulary of only 850 words. It focuses on core vocabulary and grammatical structures to maximize comprehensibility.
While these approaches don’t constitute a single, codified “International English” language, they share the common goal of making English more accessible for international communication. They all, to varying degrees, incorporate the “noun-verb-object” structure you mentioned as a fundamental element of clear and simple sentence construction.
To learn more about these concepts, you can explore the following resources:
 - Plain Language: The Plain Language Action and Information Network (PLAIN) provides guidelines and resources on plain language.
   - PLAIN.gov
 - English as a Lingua Franca (ELF): You can find information about ELF research and principles from academic sources and publications in applied linguistics.
 - Globish: The official Globish website offers details about its vocabulary and principles.
   - Globish - The global language
 - Basic English: You can find information about Basic English through online searches and in linguistic resources.
These resources can help you understand the principles and practices of communicating effectively in English with people from diverse language backgrounds, without needing to learn a completely new language like Esperanto.

Okay I didn’t like that so it’s right a different way imagine one person just one person who is traveling alone staying with a local family. think about interactions when would that person need to interact with others not alone but think about those interactions throughout the course of a typical day. For example the wake up and stretch is not relevant because that person isn’t communicating anything so we’re just talking here about communication and when there’s need to communicate in some way with another person who may not know English

Yes this is all outstanding let’s keep building on this and let’s find a way to not put headings on it so if this is so easy to understand we shouldn’t need to say what it is

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> Certainly! Let’s create a seamless narrative for a solo traveler interacting with a host family, focusing on essential communication moments without headings:
> ---
> “Good morning,” you say with a smile, nodding to each family member as you join them for breakfast. You point to the delicious spread on the table, indicating your choice with a simple “This, please,” while mimicking eating or drinking.
> Later, as you prepare to explore the area, you show your map or a picture of your destination to one of the family members. “Where?” you ask, pointing in different directions and looking inquisitive. They guide you with gestures and smiles.
> At lunchtime, you find yourself at a local spot. You point to an appetizing dish displayed or on the menu and say, “This, please.” A smile and nod confirm your order as it’s served.
> The afternoon takes you to the bustling local market. You spot an item of interest and point at it. “How much?” you inquire, showing money or using fingers to indicate numbers if bargaining is needed.
> Returning home later in the day, you express gratitude to your host family with a heartfelt “Thank you,” accompanied by a warm smile and nod.
> As dinner time approaches, you gesture towards the dining area or table and simply ask, “Dinner?” Joining them for the meal, you engage in simple conversation by pointing at the food and saying “Good?” while giving a thumbs up if you’re enjoying it.
> As night falls and you’re preparing for bed, another sincere “Thank you” is shared with your hosts. A slight bow shows respect and appreciation for their hospitality.
> ---
> By focusing on these interactions throughout the day without headings or explicit instructions, this narrative illustrates how simple phrases combined with gestures can facilitate meaningful communication between travelers and their hosts.
I like that this is starting to take on a narrative story quality so let’s say this traveler is traveling by bus or or driver or taxi places where the the person may not know much English other than very transactional English most people will know English even in a different script about money because that’s how commerce is done or things related to their domain of knowledge a taxi driver is probably going to know the English words for left and right etc so let’s use these as vignettes and again a bare minimum of English but when necessary that’s the other thing when necessary to using English otherwise nodding and gesturing and things would be preferred so let’s say a traveler arrives in a foreign country and needs to get from their point of arrival to their lodging they then need to engage in commerce perhaps for food perhaps for buying necessities things like that and get around maybe they get lost maybe they want to know where the local market is things like that and then they go to seasites and maybe they they drive or maybe they walk themselves and want directions is is this over there or there and then if staying with a local family then they engage in these kinds of transactional cultural awareness you know understanding better what is this those kinds of things and the better we can simplify this to someone who knows as little English as the traveler knows that foreign language that’s a good comparison there so what I’m saying is let’s keep building out these vignettes of of The travelers interactions based on these principles

> Arriving at the bustling airport, you step outside and spot a line of taxis. Approaching the first driver, you show them the address of your lodging written on a piece of paper. “Here,” you say, pointing to the address and then to yourself. The driver nods in understanding and gestures for you to enter the taxi.
> As the taxi weaves through unfamiliar streets, you notice a market on your map that you’d like to visit later. You point at it on your phone screen and ask, “Market?” The driver nods and points in its direction as they drive past.
> Once settled into your accommodation, hunger sets in. You venture out to find food, spotting a small eatery nearby. Inside, you point at a dish being enjoyed by another customer and say, “This, please.” A smile from the server confirms your order.
> Later, while exploring on foot, you realize you’ve lost your way back to your lodging. You approach a passerby with your map open and point to where you think you are. “Where?” you ask with an inquisitive look. They gesture down the street and make a turning motion with their hand.
> Curious about local sights, you decide to visit a nearby landmark. At the bus stop, you show an image of the landmark to another waiting passenger and say, “Bus?” They nod and hold up three fingers to indicate which bus number you’ll need.
> After returning from sightseeing, you’re invited by your host family for dinner. As dishes are passed around the table, you’re curious about one unfamiliar dish. Pointing at it with genuine interest, you ask simply, “What?” Your hosts smile and explain using gestures or simple words.
> As night falls and you’re readying for bed after an eventful day of exploration and learning new customs, another sincere “Thank you” is shared with your hosts before retiring for rest.
> ---
> These vignettes demonstrate how minimal English combined with gestures can effectively facilitate communication in various travel scenarios—from transportation to dining—while fostering cultural exchange between travelers and locals.

let’s keep refining this further for example when asking for clarity or to confirm understanding the word understand probably isn’t going to be yes no and and combine language with nonverbals shrugging shoulders etc the fewer syllables of words the better combined with minimal primitive sort of gestures what not that are universally understood just as think about street signs and pictograms universal gestures combined with simple preferably monosyllabic basic elementary School words

Why will you not say that being simple means fewer sounds fewer use words less fewer syllables imagine what it would be like not to teach English but to have to talk to aliens or talk to someone who is not human how do we talk to animals how do we talk to those who are challenged communicating or hearing like deaf
