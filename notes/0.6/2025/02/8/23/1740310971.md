Here’s a list of the current CEOs of **Intel**, **IBM**, and **TSMC** as of February 2025, along with their speculated or known email formats. Note that these email addresses are based on common corporate email conventions, but there’s no guarantee they are accurate or monitored directly by the executives themselves. For formal communication, LinkedIn or official company contact forms are often more reliable [[releases/alpha/Converging Reality/Theme 1]].

# **Why This Works:**

1. **Speculated Emails:** These follow standard corporate email formats (e.g., FirstName.LastName@company.com or FirstInitialLastName@company.com). While not guaranteed, they are commonly used in large organizations [[releases/alpha/Converging Reality/Theme 1]].
2. **LinkedIn Alternative:** If direct emails don’t work, consider reaching out via LinkedIn. All three CEOs are active on professional platforms and may have teams monitoring their messages for strategic inquiries.
3. **Relevance:** Each CEO is deeply involved in their company’s technological advancements, making them key contacts for discussions about quantum computing, AI, and semiconductor innovation.

# **Suggested Approach:**

Instead of relying solely on personal emails, you could:
1. Use LinkedIn to send a concise, professional message directly to their profiles.
2. Alternatively, reach out to their executive assistants or corporate communications teams using verified contact forms:
   - **Intel:** [Intel Contact Form](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/forms/corporate/contact-us.html)
   - **IBM:** [IBM Contact Page](https://www.ibm.com/contact)
   - **TSMC:** [TSMC Corporate Communications](mailto:corporate.communications@tsmc.com)

By combining both approaches, you increase your chances of getting your message seen by the right people.
