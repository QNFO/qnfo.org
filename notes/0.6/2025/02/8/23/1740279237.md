Are we sure we know how science works? The scientific method says nothing about the weight of confirmatory evidence to support a preferred test hypothesis. Instead we should be attempting to falsify it’s opposite (null or alternative hypothesis).

Headlines like these either misstate nuanced findings (i.e. that instead of “confirming” Einstein’s theories they disprove alternative hypotheses) or simply misapply the scientific method:

“Einstein is still winning bets – the Euclid telescope has discovered a ring in space-time”
