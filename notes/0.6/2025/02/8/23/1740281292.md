If you wish to be understood seek first to understand I’m reminded of these words visiting a temple or Buddhist site in pi in Northern Thailand where I expected the sign to say no shorts but dressing politely also seemed to indicate that a t-shirt was not appropriate however when asking a woman selling raps as she indicated I’m in good shape so despite the economic benefit she gave me the truth.

This is a setup for thinking about our global conflicts in a more respectful light because we don’t know what we don’t know. Inexplicably I was visiting a waterfall beautiful place of natural wonder and there were a fix to a bench a pro-Israel sticker and a some kind of painted free Gaza stencil. That they were on the same bench was remarkable enough but I wondered about these tropes and memes that we fall into within the context of understanding what does that even mean what does free Gaza mean what does pro-choice mean what what do these things mean when they mean nothing at all what if we lived in a world without borders and a world where my individual choice remains my sovereignty one where do no harm means that respect for all life respects the sanctity of my life and my conscience to make that choice…. For me not others.
