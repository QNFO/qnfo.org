You’re right to pause and clarify terminology. “Narrative” is often used broadly, but it’s helpful to be precise, especially when aiming for publication. Let’s break down how to describe your idea explorations, ranging from personal essays to academic articles:
1. Personal Essay:
 - Focus: Personal reflection, experience, and insights. The “I” voice is prominent. Emphasizes the writer’s unique perspective and emotional connection to the topic.
 - Style: Can be informal, conversational, and evocative. Figurative language, anecdotes, and personal stories are common.
 - Structure: More flexible than academic writing. Can be thematic, chronological, or even associative. The narrative arc is often driven by personal reflection and discovery.
 - Description: “A reflective essay exploring the intersection of personal experience and philosophical inquiry,” or “A personal journey through the landscape of shared human values.”
2.  Expository Essay:
 - Focus: Explaining, informing, or clarifying a concept or topic. The “I” voice is less prominent, and the emphasis is on presenting information clearly and accurately.
 - Style: More formal than a personal essay, but not as rigorous as academic writing. Uses clear and concise language, avoids jargon, and provides examples and illustrations to support its points.
 - Structure: Typically follows a logical structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. Can be thematic, comparative, or analytical.
 - Description: “An exploration of the common ground between diverse spiritual traditions,” or “An analysis of the ethical principles underlying human interactions.”
3.  Argumentative/Persuasive Essay:
 - Focus: Presenting a claim or thesis and supporting it with evidence and reasoning. Aims to convince the reader of the validity of the writer’s argument.
 - Style: Formal and persuasive. Uses logical arguments, evidence, and rhetorical strategies to support its claims. Addresses counterarguments and anticipates reader objections.
 - Structure: Typically follows a structured format with a clear thesis statement, supporting arguments, counterarguments, and a strong conclusion.
 - Description: “An argument for the universality of human values,” or “A case for the importance of interfaith dialogue in a pluralistic world.”
4.  Analytical Essay:
 - Focus: Breaking down a complex topic into its component parts, examining the relationships between them, and drawing conclusions based on this analysis.
 - Style: Formal and objective. Uses clear definitions, evidence, and logical reasoning to support its analysis. Avoids personal opinions or emotional appeals.
 - Structure: Organized logically, often with subheadings to guide the reader through the analysis. Provides evidence from primary and secondary sources to support its claims.
 - Description: “A comparative analysis of ethical codes across diverse religious traditions,” or “An examination of the concept of self in Buddhist and Stoic philosophy.”
5.  Research Paper/Academic Article:
 - Focus: Presenting original research or scholarship on a specific topic. Adheres to strict academic standards of evidence, documentation, and citation.
 - Style: Formal, objective, and precise. Uses specialized terminology and avoids emotional appeals. All claims are supported by rigorous evidence and cited appropriately.
 - Structure: Highly structured, typically including an abstract, introduction, literature review, methodology, results, discussion, and conclusion.
 - Description: “A comparative study of the influence of historical context on the development of ethical thought in major world religions,” or “An investigation into the cognitive basis of shared human values.”
Relating to Your Project:
Your project, exploring shared human values across traditions, could potentially fit into several of these categories, depending on your approach and goals:
 - Expository Essay: If you focus on explaining the common ground and diverse interpretations of these values, this might be the best fit.
 - Analytical Essay: If you delve deeply into comparing and contrasting specific traditions and their ethical codes, this approach could be suitable.
 - Argumentative Essay: If you aim to argue for the existence of a universal set of human values or the importance of interfaith dialogue, this structure might be appropriate.
Key Considerations:
 - Audience: Who are you writing for? A general audience or a specialized academic one?
 - Purpose: What do you hope to achieve with your writing? To inform, persuade, or explore?
 - Scope: How broad or narrow is your focus? Are you covering many traditions or focusing on a few key themes?
By carefully considering these factors, you can choose the most appropriate format and style for your writing, ensuring that your ideas are presented clearly, effectively, and in a way that resonates with your intended audience.
