# Connections as “portals” between the Physical and Informational Universes

I. Core Concept: Connections as Portals
 - A. Defining “Portal”: A bridge or interface between the physical and informational realms, where information is not merely about the physical but constitutive of it. A site of dynamic interplay and exchange.
 - B. The Primacy of Connections: “It’s the connections, not the things” as a foundational principle. Shifting focus from isolated entities to the relationships that define them.
 - C. Symbolic Referents: Exploring how symbols mediate between the physical and informational, acting as both pointers and embodiments of meaning. Distinguishing between the symbol, the referent, and the relationship between them. Examples: names, words, mathematical symbols, cultural artifacts.
II. Information Encoding and Embodiment
 - A. DNA and Biology:
   -      * DNA as informational code (genotype) and physical structure (phenotype).
   -      * Gene expression and protein synthesis as a portal: information becoming physical form and function.
   -      * The role of epigenetics in mediating gene expression through environmental information.
 - B. Language and Culture:
   -      * Language as a system of symbolic representation, shaping thought and perception.
   -      * Cultural artifacts as symbolic links to shared histories, values, and beliefs.
   -      * Memes as units of cultural information, evolving and influencing behavior.
   -      * The impact of language on physical reality (e.g., social constructs, self-fulfilling prophecies).
 - C. Mathematics and Computation:
   -      * Mathematical objects as abstract entities with physical relevance.
   -      * Mathematical equations as descriptions of physical laws.
   -      * Computation as a process of manipulating information, with physical consequences.
   -      * Zero as a portal: representing nothing, a placeholder, a point of origin, and a crucial element in mathematics and computation.
   -      * Algorithms: existing in the informational realm yet directly impacting the physical world.
III. Information, Consciousness, and Experience
 - A. Consciousness:
   -      * The hard problem of consciousness: the relationship between subjective experience and the physical brain.
   -      * Information processing as a potential bridge to understanding consciousness.
   -      * Exploring theories of consciousness that posit a connection to information.
 - B. Dreams:
   -      * Dreams as a blend of sensory input and symbolic thought.
   -      * Dreams as a potential portal to the subconscious mind.
   -      * The influence of dreams on waking life.
 - C. Placebos:
   -      * The placebo effect as evidence of the power of belief (information) to influence physical health.
   -      * The mechanisms by which beliefs affect physiological processes.
   -      * The ethical implications of the placebo effect.
IV. Information and the Physical Universe
 - A. Quantum Physics:
   -      * Quantum entanglement as a non-local connection between particles.
   -      * Wave-particle duality as a paradoxical manifestation of quantum reality.
   -      * Quantum information theory and its implications for understanding the universe.
 - B. Cosmology and Astrophysics:
   -      * Dark matter and dark energy as potential manifestations of informational structures.
   -      * Exploring cosmological models that incorporate information-theoretic principles.
   -      * Black hole information paradox and its potential resolutions.
 - C. Form and Structure:
   -      * How information dictates the structure of physical objects.
   -      * Examples: crystal formation, snowflake patterns, the Fibonacci sequence in nature.
   -      * The relationship between information, entropy, and the emergence of complexity.
V. Symbolic Referents: Deeper Dive
 - A. Names and Identity: Personal names as symbolic links to identity, family history, and cultural meaning. The act of changing one’s name as a complex interplay of personal agency, symbolic meaning, and physical reality.
 - B. Brands and Cultural Meaning: Brands as symbolic representations of companies, products, or services, evoking emotions and influencing behavior.
 - C. Art and Music: Art as symbolic expression, conveying emotions, ideas, and experiences. Music as structured sound, evoking emotions and creating shared experiences.
VI. Synthesis and Implications
 - A. Comparative Analysis: Identifying common themes and patterns across different “portals.”
 - B. Developing a Typology: Classifying “portals” based on their characteristics and functions.
 - C. Refining the Definition: Revisiting and refining the definition of “portal” in light of the research.
 - D. Challenges and Criticisms: Addressing potential limitations and criticisms of the “portal” concept.
 - E. The Informational Universe Hypothesis Revisited: Connecting the “portal” concept to the Informational Universe Hypothesis and exploring its implications for our understanding of reality.
