Patentability of Emerging Technologies: Topological Data Storage Systems, Programmable Quantum Materials, and Synthetic Biological Networks
This report analyzes the patentability of three emerging technologies: topological data storage systems, programmable quantum materials, and synthetic biological networks. It examines existing intellectual property, prior art, and recent developments in each area to identify potential challenges and opportunities for securing patent protection.
Topological Data Storage Systems
Topological data storage systems represent a nascent field with the potential to revolutionize how data is stored and accessed. By leveraging topological concepts, these systems could offer significant advantages in terms of data density, security, and stability.
Existing Intellectual Property and Prior Art
While specific patents explicitly claiming “topological data storage systems” were not found, several patents and patent applications relate to aspects of data storage that utilize topological concepts. These include:
 - Dynatrace Inc.‘s patent application (Publication Number: US20230254359A1) for real-time discovery and monitoring of multidimensional topology models for applications and computing infrastructure. This system uses agents to capture topological aspects of a distributed computing environment, enabling effective monitoring and analysis of communication relationships and execution dependencies between entities.
 - Morgan Stanley’s patent for a topology-aware distributed storage system that specifies data storage locations within a hierarchical network topology.
 - Patent application (Application #20240131424) for a method and system for incremental topological updates within a data flow graph in gaming. This application focuses on rendering virtual environments by analyzing changes in graph data and reconstructing island subgraphs.
Prior art in this area includes the Compact Abstract Cell Complexes (CACC) data structure for 3D spatial objects. This data structure provides a novel approach to representing the topology of a model in a condensed format. It achieves this by storing only the essential topological information, thereby reducing storage requirements compared to traditional methods.
Novelty and Non-Obviousness
Topological data storage systems, as a distinct category, present potential for novelty. The application of topological concepts to data storage, such as using topological properties for data organization, error correction, or security, could be considered novel and non-obvious in light of existing data storage technologies. For instance, encoding data within the topological properties of a material, such as the configuration of magnetic skyrmion strings, could offer a new paradigm for data storage with enhanced density and resilience against data corruption.
Challenges to Patentability
Challenges to patentability may arise from:
 - Eligibility criteria: Ensuring the claimed invention meets the subject matter eligibility requirements for patent protection, particularly in the context of software and data structures. For example, it may be necessary to demonstrate that the invention is not merely an abstract idea or a mathematical concept, but rather a practical application of these concepts with a concrete and tangible result.
 - Enablement requirements: Providing a sufficiently detailed description of the invention in the patent application to enable a person skilled in the art to make and use the invention. This may involve disclosing the specific algorithms, data structures, and hardware configurations used in the invention, as well as providing examples of how the invention can be implemented in practice.
 - Prior art: Demonstrating the novelty and non-obviousness of the invention in light of existing data storage technologies and topological concepts. This may require a thorough search of prior art, including patents, scientific publications, and other relevant documents, to identify any potential anticipations or obviousness rejections.
Recent Developments
Recent developments in related fields, such as the ability to fold and unfold magnetic skyrmion strings in higher dimensions , may offer insights into potential applications of topological concepts in data storage. This breakthrough could lead to the development of ultra-high-density storage devices by encoding information within the intricate topological configurations of these magnetic structures. The discovery of a new topological phase in twisted bilayer materials could also impact data storage technologies by enabling the creation of novel materials with unique electronic properties suitable for advanced memory devices.
