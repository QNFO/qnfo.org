Research Plan: Exploring the Non-Fundamental Nature of Reality
This research plan outlines a comprehensive approach to exploring the non-fundamental nature of reality, delving into various philosophical and scientific perspectives. It incorporates a multi-faceted approach, drawing upon academic research, books, online resources, expert opinions, conferences, online communities, datasets, and documentaries.
I. Foundational Inquiry: Defining the Scope
Before embarking on this research journey, it’s crucial to establish a clear understanding of the core concepts and questions that underpin the investigation into the non-fundamental nature of reality.
 - Defining “Reality”: What constitutes “reality”? Is it limited to the physical world perceived through our senses, or does it encompass a broader spectrum of existence, including consciousness, subjective experiences, and potentially even spiritual dimensions?
 - Non-Fundamental Nature: What does it mean for reality to be “non-fundamental”? Does it imply that the reality we perceive is an emergent property of a deeper, underlying reality? Or does it suggest that reality is subjective, constructed, or even illusory? This exploration necessitates an examination of the concept of “truthmakers.” Truthmakers are entities or properties that determine the truth of a statement or proposition. In the context of non-fundamental reality, the question arises whether the truth of statements about non-fundamental entities is grounded in more fundamental entities or properties.
 - Perception and Reality: It’s crucial to acknowledge that human perception can be flawed and influenced by cognitive biases. Our senses provide us with a limited and potentially distorted view of the world. Therefore, it’s essential to critically examine how our perception shapes our understanding of reality and to consider the possibility that our perceived reality may not accurately reflect the true nature of existence.
 - Philosophical Perspectives: Explore various philosophical schools of thought that address the nature of reality, such as:
   - Idealism: Reality is fundamentally mental or spiritual in nature. This perspective aligns with the notion that consciousness could be the foundation of reality, as proposed by some experts.
   - Materialism: The physical world is the foundation of reality. Materialism encompasses different forms, including:
     - Reductive Materialism: All mental phenomena can be reduced to physical processes in the brain.
     - Eliminative Materialism: Mental states, as we commonly understand them, do not exist.
   - Dualism: Both material and immaterial realms constitute reality.
   - Existentialism: Existentialism posits that individuals are thrown into an absurd and indifferent universe without any predetermined purpose or meaning. It emphasizes the freedom and responsibility of individuals to create their own meaning and shape their reality through their choices and actions.
   - Phenomenology: Reality consists of sensory experiences and perceptions.
   - Quantum Mechanics and Reality: The advent of quantum mechanics has challenged classical notions of objective reality. Quantum phenomena, such as wave-particle duality and the uncertainty principle, suggest that the act of observation influences the behavior of particles at the subatomic level. This raises profound questions about the nature of reality and the role of consciousness in shaping our understanding of the universe.
II. Research Methods and Resources
This research plan employs a diverse range of methods and resources to ensure a comprehensive exploration of the topic:

| Resource Type | Specific Resources | Research Steps |
