The algorithm of the universe can be modeled by mathematics but like a Klein bottle it cannot perfectly describe yes/no questions by binary operations (1/0). In particular if something exists and we give it a value of 1 if it stops existing in physical form a value of zero well a convenient placeholder is not correct no longer has a value we canâ€™t represent that in math, perhaps by a variable but that variable never has a value.
