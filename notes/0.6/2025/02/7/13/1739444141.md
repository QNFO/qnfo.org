# The Rise and Fall (and Rise?) of Community

**From Hunter-Gatherers to the Digital Age**

Human civilization has journeyed from small, nomadic bands of hunter-gatherers to sprawling cities, marking a profound shift in social organization. This journey has been shaped by the rise of agriculture, the development of cities, and the emergence of complex societies. Yet, amidst this trajectory of increasing interconnectedness, there are signs of a resurgence of tribalism, a retreat into smaller, self-defined groups. This article delves into the evolution of human civilization from extended family hunter-gatherer societies through the burgeoning of cities, examining evidence that suggests a potential return to smaller social units in the modern era.

## From Nomads to Settlers: The Dawn of Civilization

For most of human history, our ancestors lived as hunter-gatherers, relying on foraging and hunting for sustenance. These societies were typically small and nomadic, with social structures centered around kinship and shared survival strategies. The development of tools, such as sharpened rocks and polished stone axes, was crucial to their success, enabling them to adapt to diverse environments and exploit available resources.

Interestingly, the very act of hunting may have played a significant role in shaping human evolution. The “endurance running hypothesis” suggests that persistence hunting, a method still practiced by some hunter-gatherer groups today, may have been a driving force in the development of certain human characteristics. This method involves chasing prey over long distances, requiring stamina and efficient thermoregulation, traits that may have given early humans an evolutionary advantage.

Around 10,000 B.C., the Neolithic Revolution dramatically altered the course of human history. Humans began to cultivate plants and domesticate animals, leading to permanent settlements and the rise of agriculture. This transition was likely driven by a combination of factors. The Earth entered a warming trend around 14,000 years ago, potentially leading to changes in vegetation and encouraging the cultivation of wild grains in regions like the Fertile Crescent. Simultaneously, intellectual advancements in the human brain may have played a role, as evidenced by the discovery of religious artifacts and artistic imagery at early Neolithic settlements.

The Fertile Crescent, a region in the Middle East, was one of the cradles of this agricultural revolution. Archaeological sites like Çatalhöyük in Turkey provide valuable insights into this transition, revealing evidence of early farming practices, permanent dwellings, and the development of art and spirituality. As agricultural practices spread, human populations grew, and settlements evolved into larger, more complex societies. This led to the development of cities, with their specialized labor, centralized governance, and increased social stratification. This marked a significant departure from the egalitarian nature of hunter-gatherer societies, as social hierarchies emerged and power became concentrated in the hands of ruling elites.

However, it’s crucial to remember that the shift from hunting and gathering to agriculture wasn’t a universal phenomenon. While many societies embraced farming, hunter-gatherer communities persisted in some parts of the world. Unfortunately, these groups were often displaced or conquered by expanding agricultural or pastoralist societies. This highlights the complex interplay between different modes of subsistence and the impact of technological advancements on social organization.

## Bowling Alone: The Erosion of Social Capital

In his influential book, “Bowling Alone,” Robert Putnam argues that despite the advancements of modern society, we are experiencing a decline in social capital, the networks of relationships and norms of reciprocity that bind communities together. Putnam meticulously documents a decline in civic engagement, community involvement, and social trust in America, using the metaphor of “bowling alone” to illustrate the increasing tendency for individuals to engage in solitary activities rather than participate in social groups. He observes a decline in participation in various forms of community organizations, from bowling leagues and bridge clubs to PTAs and civic groups. This decline, he argues, has significant consequences for individual well-being, community cohesion, and the functioning of democratic institutions.

Putnam attributes this decline to a variety of factors, including generational shifts, the rise of television, urban sprawl, and the increasing pressures of time and money. He argues that these factors have led to a decrease in the frequency and quality of social interactions, resulting in a weakened sense of community and a decline in civic participation. For example, television, with its passive consumption and individualized viewing habits, may have replaced more interactive forms of social engagement. Similarly, urban sprawl, with its increased commuting times and fragmented neighborhoods, can make it more difficult for people to connect with their neighbors and participate in local communities.

However, Putnam doesn’t simply lament the decline of social capital; he also offers potential solutions. He suggests a range of strategies to revitalize community engagement, including educational reforms, family-friendly workplaces, and new urbanism. Educational reforms could focus on promoting civic engagement through service learning programs and extracurricular activities. Family-friendly workplaces could provide more flexibility and support for parents, allowing them to balance work and family responsibilities while also participating in community life. New urbanism, an urban design movement that promotes walkable neighborhoods and mixed-use development, could help create more vibrant and connected communities.

While Putnam’s work primarily focuses on America, his observations resonate with broader social trends observed in many developed societies. The decline in social capital has significant implications for individual well-being, community cohesion, and the functioning of democratic institutions. A society with low social capital may experience higher crime rates, reduced economic prosperity, and a decline in political participation. This underscores the importance of investing in social connections and fostering a sense of community.

## The Tribal Impulse: Are We Devolving?

While the rise of cities and the growth of global interconnectedness might suggest an ever-increasing integration of human societies, there is evidence that points to a countervailing trend: a resurgence of tribalism, a retreat into smaller, self-defined groups. This trend manifests in various ways, from the rise of online communities to the increasing prominence of identity politics.

## Technology’s Double-Edged Sword

Technology, while often touted as a tool for connection, can also contribute to social fragmentation. On the one hand, technology can enhance communication and strengthen relationships. Video calling apps like Skype and Zoom allow people to experience emotional connections without being in the same room, bridging geographical distances and fostering a sense of closeness. Social media platforms can help people stay connected with loved ones, share experiences, and build communities around shared interests.

On the other hand, the rise of social media, with its echo chambers and filter bubbles, can reinforce existing divisions and create online communities that are more homogeneous than diverse. Algorithms designed to personalize content can inadvertently limit exposure to diverse perspectives, reinforcing existing biases and creating online echo chambers where individuals primarily interact with like-minded people. This can lead to increased polarization and a decline in empathy for those with different viewpoints.

The increasing reliance on digital communication can also lead to a decline in face-to-face interactions, potentially weakening social skills and reducing opportunities for meaningful connections. While technology can facilitate communication across vast distances, it can also create a sense of isolation and detachment from local communities. This is particularly concerning for young people, who may be more susceptible to the negative impacts of excessive technology use. Studies have shown that teens who heavily rely on technology for social interaction may experience difficulties with face-to-face communication and social development. The COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated this trend, as lockdowns and social distancing measures forced people to rely even more heavily on digital communication.

Moreover, the anonymity and accessibility of online spaces can create new risks, such as cyberbullying and online deception. Cyberbullying, the use of electronic communication to bully a person, has become a growing concern, particularly among young people. Online deception, such as catfishing, the creation of a fake online identity to manipulate or abuse someone, is another risk associated with increased online interaction.

## The Rise of Identity Politics

Another factor contributing to the resurgence of tribalism is the rise of identity politics, a focus on group identity and the assertion of rights based on shared characteristics such as race, gender, or ethnicity. While identity politics can be a powerful force for social justice and inclusion, it can also lead to increased polarization and the formation of exclusive groups based on identity.

The emphasis on group identity can sometimes overshadow commonalities and shared values, potentially hindering dialogue and cooperation across different groups. This can lead to a fragmentation of society into smaller, self-defined tribes, each with its own set of values and priorities. In the digital age, this fragmentation can be amplified by online platforms that allow individuals to connect with others based on shared identities, potentially reinforcing in-group biases and creating echo chambers where diverse perspectives are limited.

However, it’s important to acknowledge the positive aspects of identity politics. It can empower marginalized groups, giving them a voice and a platform to advocate for their rights and interests. It can also raise awareness of social injustices and promote a greater understanding of the experiences of different groups.

## The Allure of Smaller Communities

The trend towards smaller groups is also evident in the rise of online communities centered around niche interests, hobbies, or shared identities. These communities can provide a sense of belonging and connection, particularly for individuals who feel alienated from mainstream society or who seek deeper connections with like-minded individuals. They offer a space for individuals to share their passions, seek support, and build relationships with others who understand their interests.

The growth of these smaller communities may be a response to the perceived impersonality of larger social structures and the desire for more intimate and authentic connections. In a world that can often feel overwhelming and fragmented, smaller groups can offer a sense of stability, support, and shared identity. This is particularly relevant in the digital age, where individuals may have vast networks of online connections but lack deep, meaningful relationships.

However, it’s important to consider the potential downsides of this trend. While smaller communities can provide a sense of belonging, they can also become insular and exclusive, potentially reinforcing existing biases and limiting exposure to diverse perspectives. This can lead to echo chambers where individuals primarily interact with like-minded people, potentially hindering critical thinking and fostering intolerance.

## Counterpoint: Global Interconnectedness and Diverse Communities

While there is evidence to suggest a resurgence of tribalism, it is important to acknowledge the countervailing forces of global interconnectedness and increasing diversity in many communities.

### The Global Village

Globalization has led to unprecedented levels of interconnectedness, with the flow of information, ideas, and people across borders creating a more integrated world. This interconnectedness can foster cultural exchange, promote understanding, and create opportunities for collaboration on a global scale. The rise of global media, international trade, and migration patterns has contributed to the growth of diverse communities in many parts of the world. This diversity can enrich societies, fostering innovation, creativity, and a broader understanding of different cultures.
Social networking sites have played a significant role in facilitating this global interconnectedness. They allow individuals to connect with people from different cultures, share experiences, and learn from one another. This can help break down stereotypes, promote empathy, and foster a sense of global citizenship.

However, it’s important to acknowledge the potential negative impacts of social networking sites. Excessive use can lead to addiction, social comparison, and a decline in real-life social interaction. Privacy concerns are also a significant issue, as social media platforms collect vast amounts of personal data.

## The Strength of Diversity

Diverse communities can be more resilient and adaptable, with a wider range of perspectives and experiences contributing to problem-solving and innovation. The exchange of ideas and knowledge across different cultures can lead to new insights and solutions to global challenges. This diversity can manifest in various ways, from ethnic and cultural diversity to diversity of thought and experience.

Governments can play a crucial role in preserving and promoting cultural diversity. They can support local cultural industries, such as music, film, and art, by providing financial assistance and protecting them from foreign competition. This can help preserve cultural heritage, create jobs, and promote cultural expression.

## Comparing the Evidence: A Nuanced Perspective

While the evidence suggests a tension between the trend towards smaller, self-defined groups and the forces of global interconnectedness, it’s important to avoid oversimplifying the situation. The reality is complex and multifaceted. On the one hand, there is a clear trend towards smaller communities, driven by factors such as the rise of online platforms, the increasing prominence of identity politics, and the desire for more intimate and authentic connections. On the other hand, globalization continues to connect people across borders, creating diverse communities and fostering cultural exchange.

It’s crucial to recognize that these trends are not mutually exclusive. Individuals can simultaneously belong to smaller, self-defined groups and participate in larger, more diverse communities. The challenge lies in finding a balance between these different forms of social organization, fostering a sense of belonging while also embracing diversity and promoting global cooperation.

## Navigating the Tension Between Tribalism and Globalism

The evidence suggests that we are navigating a complex and dynamic social landscape, with both tribalistic and globalizing forces at play. The resurgence of tribalism may be a reaction to the perceived impersonality of modern society, the anxieties of globalization, and the desire for a stronger sense of belonging. This harkens back to our hunter-gatherer ancestors, who relied on strong social bonds within their small groups for survival. In the modern world, this need for belonging may manifest in different ways, such as joining online communities, identifying with specific social groups, or participating in local initiatives.

However, the forces of global interconnectedness and increasing diversity offer a counterpoint to this trend, creating opportunities for cultural exchange, collaboration, and the development of more inclusive societies. This interconnectedness can broaden our horizons, expose us to new ideas, and challenge our preconceived notions.

The challenge lies in finding a balance between these competing forces, fostering a sense of community and belonging while also embracing diversity and global interconnectedness. This requires a commitment to dialogue, understanding, and the recognition of shared values across different groups. It also requires a critical awareness of the potential downsides of both tribalism and globalism. Tribalism can lead to exclusion, prejudice, and conflict, while globalism can exacerbate inequalities and erode local cultures.
The future of human civilization may depend on our ability to navigate this tension, harnessing the strengths of both tribalism and globalism to create a more just, sustainable, and interconnected world. This requires a shift in mindset, from a focus on narrow group identities to a broader sense of shared humanity and interconnectedness.

## Implications for the Future

The trends discussed in this article have significant implications for the future of human civilization. The resurgence of tribalism, if left unchecked, could lead to increased social fragmentation, conflict, and a decline in cooperation on global challenges. This could manifest in various ways, such as increased political polarization, social unrest, and a decline in international cooperation.

However, the forces of global interconnectedness and diversity offer hope for a more integrated and inclusive future. By fostering dialogue, understanding, and a recognition of shared values, we can harness the strengths of both tribalism and globalism to create a more just and sustainable world. This requires a commitment to education, cultural exchange, and the promotion of empathy and understanding across different groups.

The challenge lies in finding ways to cultivate a sense of belonging and community while also embracing diversity and promoting global cooperation. This requires a shift in mindset, from a focus on narrow group identities to a broader sense of shared humanity and interconnectedness. It also requires a willingness to engage in difficult conversations, challenge our own biases, and work towards a more just and equitable world.

The future of human civilization may depend on our ability to navigate this tension, creating a world where both individual identity and global community can thrive. Let us embrace this challenge, working together to build a future where diversity is celebrated, cooperation is valued, and all individuals have the opportunity to belong.
