# Fact: Worries Become Unrecognizable

I worry. It’s a feeling I know well. Yet, a clear fact from my own life experience keeps coming to mind: worries don’t last in the way they feel they will. Over time, they change. More accurately, *life* changes around them, and *I* change in relation to them, to the point where past worries become almost unrecognizable in my present.

Looking back, this is simply what happens. Think of any problem, any worry that once felt large and pressing. I have. And when I do, I realize something striking: the intense feeling surrounding that worry is gone. The urgency, the anxiety, the sense of it being all-consuming – it has simply dissipated. The problem itself, whatever it was, has transformed into something distant, something without the power it once held.

It’s not just that past problems get solved or resolved in neat ways. It’s deeper than that. They become disconnected from my current reality. They lose their sharpness, their emotional charge. They become… well, unrecognizable *as* the significant worries they once were. It’s like trying to recall a dream – the outlines might be there, but the feeling, the vividness, is completely faded.

This is my direct experience. It’s not a theory or a hope; it’s what I have observed in my own life, time and time again. Worries that once dominated my thoughts and feelings have, without exception, become something different. Something smaller. Something less significant. Often, something I barely even remember in detail.

Knowing this fact, based purely on my own past, is starting to shift something in me. When worry arises now, I have this factual knowledge to draw upon. I can remind myself: *This feeling, this urgent concern, is not permanent. It is temporary. It will, like all past worries, become something unrecognizable in my future.*

This is not about denying the reality of current challenges. It’s about understanding the nature of worry itself, based on direct, personal evidence. It’s about recognizing that the intensity of worry in the present moment is not an accurate predictor of its lasting impact. My own life shows me that worries, by their very nature, become unrecognizable over time. And that simple, factual observation is becoming a powerful source of calm and a quiet kind of confidence as I move forward.
