Research Plan: Exploring Transformers, Morphism, and the Informational/Physical Universe
This research plan outlines a structured approach to investigating the relationship between transformer models in GPT LLMs, the concept of morphism, and their potential effects on the informational and physical universes, with a focus on the role of microtubules.
I. Core Entities and Concepts:
 - Transformer Model:
   - Architecture and mechanisms (self-attention, encoder-decoder structure)
   - Function as a morphism in mapping token sequences to vector representations
   - Strengths and limitations compared to other neural network architectures (RNNs, LSTMs)
 - Morphism:
   - Mathematical definition and properties
   - Application to understanding the transformer’s structure-preserving mapping
   - Potential implications for information processing and representation
 - Microtubules:
   - Structure and function in biological neurons
   - Potential role in information processing and consciousness
   - Relationship to neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive plasticity
 - Informational Universe:
   - Definition and characteristics
   - Impact of transformers on knowledge creation, communication, and creative expression
   - Relationship to the physical universe through information as a fundamental building block
 - Physical Universe:
   - Influence of the informational universe on physical processes and events
   - Potential impact of transformers on automation, robotics, scientific discovery, and social change
II. Interrelationships:
