To prioritize the most promising yet underrepresented areas for further investigation, we need to evaluate which inferences and potential breakthrough innovations are strongly implied by existing knowledge but have not yet received sufficient attention in research or technology development. Below is a prioritized list of these areas, ranked by their potential impact and the gap between their theoretical promise and current exploration.

  - Biological neurons leverage microtubules for **intracellular transport** and **signal integration**, suggesting they could enhance AI models.
- **Potential Breakthrough**:
  - Develop **microtubule-inspired neural networks** that incorporate oscillatory dynamics for improved learning and memory.

- **Existing Knowledge**:
  - Hebbian learning aligns with **neuroplasticity** and **spike-timing-dependent plasticity** (STDP) in biological systems.
  - It offers a more energy-efficient and adaptive approach to learning compared to backpropagation.
- **Potential Breakthrough**:
  - Combine Hebbian learning with **meta-learning** to create AI systems that adapt quickly to new tasks with minimal data.
  - Develop **self-organizing AI** that continuously learns from sparse or streaming data.
- **Actionable Steps**:
  - Experiment with Hebbian-based training algorithms in reinforcement learning or few-shot learning tasks.
  - Build neuromorphic hardware that implements Hebbian plasticity for real-time adaptation.
