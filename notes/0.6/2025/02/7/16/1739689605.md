Expanding the web of entities and relationships from the article involves integrating interdisciplinary concepts to create a richer framework for understanding neural network evolution and future directions. Below is an organized expansion, structured into key themes and their interconnections:

---

# **1. Category Theory and Structural Preservation**

- **Entities**: Morphisms, Functors, Natural Transformations, Category Theory.
- **Relationships**:
  - **Morphisms** in neural networks align with **category theory**, where structure-preserving maps (e.g., homomorphisms) describe transformations between biological and artificial networks.
  - **Functors** map entire network architectures (e.g., CNNs to RNNs), while **natural transformations** compare learning processes across models.
  - Connects to **MLPs** and **Transformers** by formalizing how hierarchical layers preserve semantic meaning.

# **2. Advanced Graph-Based Models**

- **Entities**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Directed/Undirected Graphs, Recurrent Networks.
- **Relationships**:
  - **GNNs** extend **graph theory** to handle non-Euclidean data (e.g., social networks), mirroring brain connectivity.
  - **Cyclic graphs** model **RNNs**, capturing temporal dependencies akin to biological neural feedback loops.
  - **Convolutional Graph Networks** share weights spatially, inspired by the brain’s visual cortex.
