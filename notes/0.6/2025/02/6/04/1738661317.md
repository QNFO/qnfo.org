## **[3] Field of the Invention**

[0001] The present invention relates generally to quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum sensing. More specifically, it relates to systems and methods for intentionally inducing and leveraging controlled decoherence as a computational resource.

---

## **[4] Background of the Invention**

[0002] Quantum coherence is essential for quantum computation, communication, and sensing. However, maintaining coherence remains a significant challenge due to environmental interactions that cause decoherence. Current approaches focus on minimizing decoherence through extreme isolation (e.g., cryogenic cooling) or error-correction schemes, which are resource-intensive and limit scalability.

[0003] Recent discoveries in quantum biology suggest that biological systems, such as neuronal microtubules, may utilize decoherence as part of their information-processing mechanisms. These systems operate at ambient temperatures, challenging the assumption that decoherence is inherently detrimental.

[0004] By intentionally inducing and controlling decoherence, it is possible to harness this phenomenon as a computational resource, enabling new paradigms in quantum error correction, dynamic qubit states, and hybrid quantum-classical systems.
