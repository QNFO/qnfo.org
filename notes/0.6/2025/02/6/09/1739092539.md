To assess the prior art and potential rejections for receiving a US patent for each of the claims outlined in the provided document, we need to evaluate them against the criteria of novelty, non-obviousness, and utility. Additionally, we must consider existing patents, scientific literature, and technological advancements in quantum biology, materials science, and quantum technologies. Below is an analysis of each claim, prioritizing those with a high likelihood of patentability and commercial success.
