Thoughts

> The user wants the complete revised manifesto draft.
> This draft needs to incorporate:
>  - Triviality of the Billion Dollars & “Catalyst” Framing: Explicitly state the billion is small and acts as a catalyst for larger change.
>  - Aspirational “We”: Clarify “we” refers to the vision, not a pre-existing organization.
>  - Re-injected Details:
>    - Inverted Pyramid/Iceberg Metaphor (prominently)
>    - Benefit-Cost Ratios (with estimates, for each initiative)
>    - Long-Term vs. Short-Term Thinking (highlighted contrast)
>    - Systems Thinking & Foundations (explicitly stated for initiatives)
>    - Empowerment vs. Dependency (explicitly stated for initiatives)
>    - Global Scale & Universal Benefit (reinforced throughout)
>  - Call out Greed & Self-Interest (as before)
>  - Focus on Specific Initiatives (with concrete examples as before)
>  - Emblematic Figures (Child in Africa, Woman in India - woven throughout)
>  - Knowledge as a Public Utility, AI as the Conduit (core framing for AI initiative)
> I need to carefully weave all these elements into the existing manifesto draft, ensuring smooth transitions and impactful language. I will generate the complete manifesto draft, incorporating all these points as requested.
