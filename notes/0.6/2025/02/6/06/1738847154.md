### **1. What Is Gravity, and How Does It Emerge from Information?**

#### **Explanation**:
Gravity is not a fundamental force but an emergent phenomenon arising from the global informational framework. Spacetime curvature, traditionally described by general relativity, reflects underlying informational constraints.

- **Mechanism**: 
  - High informational density creates "wells" in the informational landscape, analogous to how mass-energy curves spacetime.
  - Gravitational effects (e.g., orbits, time dilation) emerge as systems align with these informational patterns.

### **2. What Causes Wavefunction Collapse, and How Does It Relate to Information?**

#### **Explanation**:
Wavefunction collapse—the transition of a quantum system from superposition to a definite state—is an **informational update** driven by interaction with the global informational framework.

- **Mechanism**:
  - Measurement introduces new information into the system, collapsing its probabilistic state into a specific outcome.
  - Decoherence reflects degradation of accessible information, ensuring consistency with the surrounding environment.

- **Natural Language Equation**:
  *If wavefunction collapse reflects informational dynamics, then it must leave observable traces in quantum systems.*

### **3. What Is the Observer Effect, and Why Does It Matter?**

#### **Explanation**:
The observer effect refers to changes in a system caused by the act of measurement. Within the informational framework, observation updates the system’s informational state.

- **Mechanism**:
  - Observers interact with the global informational framework, introducing constraints that reduce uncertainty.
  - The act of measurement forces the system to "choose" a state consistent with the updated information.
