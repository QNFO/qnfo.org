The user raises a compelling point about the survival of common ancestors and its implications for our perception of human intelligence. Here’s a breakdown of the argument and some related considerations:

**Argument:**

- **Premise:** If humans were truly as intelligent as we believe, the common ancestor of *Homo sapiens* (or their direct descendants) should still be alive.
- **Implication:** The fact that this ancestor is extinct suggests a flaw in our understanding of intelligence as a guarantee of survival.
- **Extension:** This leads to the question of whether any species exist today whose common ancestor also exists.

**Analysis:**

- **Intelligence vs. Survival:** The user’s argument challenges the notion that intelligence automatically equates to survival. Evolutionary success is a complex interplay of factors, including adaptability, environmental conditions, chance events, and competition. Intelligence, while advantageous, is not a sole determinant.
- **The Nature of Extinction:** Extinction is a natural process. Most species that have ever existed are now extinct. This underscores the fragility of life and the challenges of long-term survival.
- **Common Ancestors:** The concept of a “common ancestor” is central to evolutionary biology. It refers to a species from which two or more other species have diverged. Identifying specific common ancestors and their survival status can be complex, especially over long evolutionary timescales.
- **Living Fossils:** There are species often referred to as “living fossils” that have changed relatively little over millions of years. Examples include:
    - **Coelacanths:** These deep-sea fish have remained largely unchanged for over 400 million years.
    - **Horseshoe crabs:** These ancient arthropods have existed for over 450 million years.
    - These examples show that some lineages have demonstrated remarkable resilience.

**Implications:**

- The user’s argument prompts reflection on the hubris of human exceptionalism. It encourages a more nuanced understanding of intelligence and its role in evolution.
- The question about species with surviving common ancestors highlights the diversity of evolutionary trajectories and the varied success of different lineages.
- It also highlights that perhaps intelligence is a double edged sword. It allows for advanced problem solving but also the ability to create existential threats.

**Further Exploration:**

- Research into the factors that contribute to long-term evolutionary success.
- Studies on the evolution of intelligence and its relationship to survival.
- Exploration of the concept of “living fossils” and their evolutionary significance.
- The impact of human activity on the rate of extinction in the present day, and how that compares to previous extinction events.

In conclusion, the user’s argument offers a thought-provoking perspective on human intelligence and the challenges of survival. It encourages a deeper appreciation for the complexities of evolution and the interconnectedness of life.
