Okay, here’s the list of hashtags you provided, re-ordered in terms of general importance for your overall presence and discoverability on Mastodon (specifically mstdn.science), and presented as a space-separated list. I’ve prioritized based on the following factors:
 - Broad Reach: Hashtags that will connect you to the largest relevant audiences on mstdn.science.
 - Relevance to your Core Work: Focusing on Quantum Computing, AI, and their intersection with social good.
 - Mastodon Culture: Prioritizing hashtags that are commonly used and understood within the Mastodon community.
 - Specificity Balance: Balancing broad terms with more niche ones for targeted reach.
 - Avoidance of overly-hyped terms: Some terms in the quantum space are overused and don’t convey concrete information.
Here’s the prioritized, space-separated list:
#Science #Technology #Tech #AI #ArtificialIntelligence #MachineLearning #ML #QuantumComputing #Quantum #QuantumTech #DataScience #Innovation #STEM #AIforGood #EthicalAI #TechForGood #SocialGood #QuantumAlgorithms #SustainableDevelopment #DigitalEthics #AIethics #NLP #ComputerVision #OpenScience #AcademicMastodon #SciComm #Introductions #FollowFriday #FF #Fedi22 #FediScience #DigitalNomad #ExpatLife #Thailand #ChiangMai #SoutheastAsia #QNFO #BigData #DeepLearning #QuantumPhysics #QuantumMechanics #QuantumTechnology #QuantumComputingNow #SDGs #QuantumSupremacy
Explanation of Prioritization and Grouping:
 - Top Tier (Broadest Reach & Core Relevance):
   - #Science #Technology #Tech #AI #ArtificialIntelligence #MachineLearning #ML #QuantumComputing #Quantum #QuantumTech #DataScience #Innovation #STEM
   - These are fundamental and widely used on mstdn.science. They establish your core areas.
 - Second Tier (Social Impact & Ethics):
   - #AIforGood #EthicalAI #TechForGood #SocialGood #QuantumAlgorithms #SustainableDevelopment #DigitalEthics #AIethics
   - These highlight the important ethical and societal dimensions of your work, which is crucial for engagement on Mastodon. QuantumAlgorithms is moved up because it combines your two main focuses.
 - Third Tier (Specific Subfields & Practices):
   - #NLP #ComputerVision #OpenScience #AcademicMastodon #SciComm
   - These are more specialized but still widely recognized. Use them when relevant to your specific post.
 - Fourth Tier (Mastodon Community & Interaction):
   - #Introductions #FollowFriday #FF #Fedi22 #FediScience
   - Essential for getting started and participating in the Mastodon community.
 - Fifth Tier (Location & Lifestyle):
   - #DigitalNomad #ExpatLife #Thailand #ChiangMai #SoutheastAsia
   - Important for connecting with people in your region, but secondary to your professional work.
 - Sixth Tier (Company & Less-Critical Tech):
   - #QNFO #BigData #DeepLearning
   - Important to tag your own work, but not main tags for finding new viewers. #BigData and #DeepLearning are often related to your work, but are not as central as the higher-tier tags.
 - Seventh Tier (More Specific Quantum, Use Sparingly):
   - #QuantumPhysics #QuantumMechanics #QuantumTechnology #QuantumComputingNow #SDGs #QuantumSupremacy
   - These are valid, but some (like QuantumSupremacy) are controversial or potentially overused. Use them judiciously and only when very specifically relevant. #SDGs should be used only when directly referencing a specific Sustainable Development Goal. #QuantumTechnology and #QuantumComputingNow are valid but slightly redundant given the higher priority #QuantumTech and #QuantumComputing.
Important Considerations:
 - This is a general prioritization. The best hashtags for any given toot will depend on the specific content of that toot.
 - Don’t use all of these in every toot! Choose the 3-7 most relevant ones.
 - Camel Case: Remember to use CamelCase (e.g., #QuantumComputing) for accessibility.
 - Experiment: Track which hashtags seem to lead to the most engagement and adjust your usage accordingly.
 - Content Warnings: For complex and potentially misunderstood topics, use CWs appropriately.
This prioritized list provides a strong foundation for your Mastodon hashtag strategy. Good luck!
