Indeed microtubules are critical to the cellular architecture of a neuron, but alas, they are not more involved in information processing than mitochondria or the cytoplasmic membrane and its ion channels and receptors. Microtubules are an integral part of a neuron. Without them the neuron couldnâ€™t maintain its 3d structure nor its mitochondria and other organelles anchored at the right places, nor transport materials to and from the soma.
