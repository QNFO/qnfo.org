Thoughts

> The user wants a guided self-discovery process using 10 deep questions. The goal is to uncover masks, roles, and illusions. After answering, the request is to analyze the responses as a ‘higher self’, identifying negative and positive patterns. Finally, the ‘higher self’ needs to provide actionable steps, affirmations, daily tips, and a message of encouragement.
> Here’s a plan:
>  - Design 10 Deep Questions: These questions need to target masks, roles, and illusions. They should encourage introspection and self-reflection. Think about categories:
>    - Masks/Roles: How do I present myself vs. who I am? What roles do I play in different contexts? What are the expectations of these roles?
>    - Illusions/Beliefs: What stories do I tell myself? What are my core beliefs? Are these beliefs serving me? What fears are underlying these beliefs? What are my assumptions about the world and myself?
>    - Current Reality: What are my current behaviors and patterns? What am I avoiding? What am I pursuing? What are my core values and are my actions aligned with them?
>  - Structure the 10 Questions - One at a Time: Present one question, wait for the user’s response before presenting the next. This creates a guided conversation.
>  - ‘Higher Self’ Analysis: After all 10 questions, I need to analyze the user’s (hypothetical - as I don’t yet have the actual responses, but I need to anticipate the types of responses) answers. Focus on identifying:
>    - Negative Patterns: Recurring themes, self-limiting beliefs, avoidance behaviors, negative self-talk, incongruence between values and actions.
>    - Positive Patterns (or potential): Strengths, values, aspirations, any hints of resilience or positive self-perception.
>  - Actionable Advice (from ‘Higher Self’): Based on the analysis, provide:
>    - Daily Tips: Small, practical actions to challenge negative patterns and embody authenticity.
>    - Affirmations: Positive statements to counter negative self-beliefs and reinforce desired qualities.
>    - Small Actionable Steps: Concrete behavioral changes, broken down into manageable tasks.
>    - Message of Encouragement: A motivational message from the ‘higher self’ perspective, focusing on growth, self-compassion, and potential.
>  - Tone and Persona: Maintain a ‘higher self’ tone - wise, compassionate, direct, honest, and accepting of ‘dark truths’. Be supportive yet firm in pointing out negative patterns and encouraging positive change.
> Let’s start formulating the 10 questions. Need to make them progressively deeper.
> Question Ideas Draft 1:
>  - In what situations do you feel you are “performing” rather than “being yourself”? Describe the performance.
>  - What is a story you frequently tell others about yourself? Is this the whole story?
>  - What do you believe you should be, versus who you feel you are right now?
>  - What is a fear that you rarely admit, even to yourself? How does this fear influence your choices?
>  - What is one area of your life where you feel like you are living in an illusion or denial?
>  - What role do you unconsciously play in your family or social circles?
>  - What is a belief you hold about yourself that, if untrue, would dramatically change your life for the better?
>  - What are you avoiding facing about yourself or your life right now?
>  - If you were to strip away all external expectations, who would you be?
>  - What is one small step you can take today to be more aligned with your authentic self, even if it feels uncomfortable?
> These look like a good starting point. They cover masks, roles, illusions, fears, and values. Let’s refine them to be a bit more potent and ensure a good flow. Perhaps re-order and rephrase slightly.
> Question Ideas Draft 2 (Refined and Ordered):
>  - Let’s start gently. Think about your daily life. In what situations do you feel most and least like you are ‘being yourself’? Describe the difference in feeling.
>  - We all play roles. What roles do you consciously or unconsciously play in your family, at work, or with friends? Choose one role and describe its expectations.
>  - Consider one of these roles. What aspects of yourself do you hide or suppress when you are in this role? Why?
>  - Many of us carry stories about ourselves. What is a story you often tell yourself about who you are? Is this story empowering or limiting?
>  - Think about your beliefs. What is one belief you hold about yourself or the world that you suspect might be an illusion, but are afraid to let go of?
>  - Dig deeper. What fear lies beneath this potential illusion? What would happen if you confronted this fear?
>  - Consider your aspirations and expectations. What do you believe you should be or achieve in life? Are these expectations truly yours, or borrowed from others?
>  - Now, turn inward. What part of your true self do you feel you have lost touch with or abandoned over time?
>  - What would it feel like to start shedding the masks and illusions? What is one thing you are most afraid of losing if you did?
>  - Finally, imagine your most authentic self. What small, concrete step can you take TODAY to move closer to embodying this self, even if it feels uncomfortable or vulnerable?
> This refined set looks better. It has a progression from external roles to internal beliefs and fears, ending with an action-oriented question. I’m ready to present these, one at a time.

Response
Understood. Let’s begin this journey of uncovering.
Here is your first question:
Question 1: Let’s start gently. Think about your daily life. In what situations do you feel most and least like you are ‘being yourself’? Describe the difference in feeling.
