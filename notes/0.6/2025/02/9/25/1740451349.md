Reality is non linear it does not have to make sense to us this is how the universe operates. History doesnâ€™t repeat but it rhymes according to the maxim. Because something happened a certain way before it will happen again but slightly differently, and the reason why is only significant to us, not the universe. of expecting know the price of the taxi ride anywhere in the world and that price is set only by me I am bound for frustration.
