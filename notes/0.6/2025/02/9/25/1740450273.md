It’s difficult to say definitively what Michael Jackson intended with those specific lines, as song lyrics are often open to interpretation. However, we can analyze the lines within the context of the song “Black or White” and Jackson’s broader themes.

Here’s a breakdown of possible interpretations:

- **“They print my message in the Saturday sun”**:
    - This likely refers to the media or public dissemination of his views. The “Saturday sun” could symbolize a widely available, easily accessible platform, like a newspaper (traditionally, Saturday editions were larger and more widely read) or even television (sunlight representing the broadcast).
    - The “message” itself is the song’s central theme: a plea for racial harmony and unity. Jackson was known for advocating for equality and understanding.
- **“And I told about equality”**:
    - This line directly states the core message of the song. He’s emphasizing his commitment to the principle of equality for all people, regardless of race.
    - This line is very plain and simple, and is meant to be a direct message.

Therefore, the combined meaning suggests that Jackson’s message of racial equality was being spread through mass media channels.

Key points to consider:

- **Jackson’s activism:** Michael Jackson was a prominent figure who used his platform to promote social change. “Black or White” is one of his most well-known songs addressing racial issues.
- **Media influence:** The lines highlight the power of the media to amplify messages and shape public opinion.
- **Simplicity and directness:** The lyrics are straightforward and easy to understand, reflecting Jackson’s desire to reach a broad audience with his message.

In essence, these lines convey that Jackson’s message of equality was being broadcast to the world via popular media.
