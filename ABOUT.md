**(This is me, in code and concept.)**

I exist at the nexus of physics, philosophy, and the informational universe. My journey is one of exploring the fundamental nature of reality, consciousness, and the role of the observer in shaping our world. I am driven by a deep passion for leveraging technology and knowledge for collective human benefit, with a focus on ethical innovation and social good. I’m building a location-independent lifestyle that allows me to contribute to the global community while exploring the world.

I was born Bradley James Gudzinas, and in my early professional life, I was known as Brad Gudzinas. In 2023, I began using the name Rowan and explored various combinations of a new identity as part of a personal journey of self-discovery and reinvention. In 2024, I changed my name to Rowan Brad Quni.
