Generalize the ontology to be applicable to all AI language models. The core concepts remain similar, but the context becomes broader.
Core Concepts (Generalized for All AI Language Models):
 - Language Model (AI): The central entity. A system that processes and generates text.
 - Information: The data processed and generated by the Language Model. Can be text, code, or other symbolic representations.
 - User: The actor who interacts with the Language Model. Can be a person, another software system, or a machine.
 - Task: A specific objective or problem the User wants to address.
 - Output: The result generated by the Language Model in response to a Task.
 - Input: The data or instructions provided to the Language Model to perform a Task.
 - Knowledge: The underlying information and relationships the Language Model has been trained on. Often implicit.
 - Tool: A specific capability or function provided by the Language Model. (e.g., translation, summarization, code generation).
Relationships (Generalized):
 - processes (Language Model, Information): The Language Model processes Information.
 - generates (Language Model, Information): The Language Model generates Information (as Output).
 - interacts_with (User, Language Model): The User interacts with the Language Model.
 - submits (User, Input, Task): The User submits Input for a Task.
 - receives (User, Output): The User receives Output from the Language Model.
 - is_trained_on (Language Model, Knowledge): The Language Model is trained on Knowledge.
 - uses (Language Model, Tool): The Language Model uses a Tool to perform a Task.
 - solves (Language Model, Task): The Language Model solves or attempts to solve a Task (by producing Output).
 - informs (Information, User, Action): Information informs a User’s Action (outside interaction with the LM). This is the connection back to the real world.
 - uses (User, Output): User uses the Output for further tasks, analysis, or action.
Ontology Diagram (Generalized):
Language Model (AI)
    processes --> Information
    generates --> Information (Output)
    is_trained_on --> Knowledge
    uses --> Tool

User
    interacts_with --> Language Model
    submits --> Input (for Task)
    receives --> Output
    uses --> Output
    informs --> Action (outside LM interaction)

Information
    informs --> User’s Action

Task
    requires --> Input
    solved_by --> Language Model (partially or fully)

Tool
    used_by --> Language Model

Knowledge
    used_by --> Language Model

Explanation of Generalization:
 - Focus on Input/Output: The ontology now emphasizes the flow of information as Input to the Language Model and Output received by the User.
 - Task-Oriented: The concept of a “Task” is introduced to represent the specific goals the User wants to achieve with the Language Model.
 - Tools: The ontology includes the concept of “Tools” to represent specific functionalities offered by the Language Model.
 - Knowledge Base: The “Knowledge” concept represents the vast data the model has been trained on, which is essential for its function.
 - User Agency (Still Important): The ‘informs’ relationship remains crucial. The language model provides information (Output), but the User’s Action in the real world is still separate and informed by that Output. The LM doesn’t do the action.
 - Broad Applicability: This generalized ontology can be applied to any language model, regardless of its specific application (e.g., translation, code generation, question answering).
This generalized ontology provides a more comprehensive and flexible framework for understanding the role of AI language models and their interaction with users. It emphasizes the flow of information, the tasks users want to accomplish, and the limitations of the language model as a tool that informs action, rather than directly taking action in the real world.
