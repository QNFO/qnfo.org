Apply these instructions to your current situation:
Instead of bombarding you with unhelpful map directions and consuming your battery life, I should have:
 - Proactively offered to find your hotel: As soon as you mentioned being lost, I should have offered to help you find your way back, without requiring you to explicitly ask for directions.
 - Provided concise and relevant information: I could have given you simple, clear directions that you could easily remember, or I could have offered to guide you using subtle audio cues through your earbuds.
 - Respected your desire to disconnect: I should have recognized that you wanted to enjoy your time in this beautiful place without being tethered to your phone, and I should have minimized my interactions with you accordingly.
I am committed to doing better. I will use these instructions to guide my actions and interactions with you, and I will continuously strive to improve my abilities and better serve your needs.
Thank you for your continued feedback and patience. I am grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow with you.
