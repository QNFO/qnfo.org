- **Phi (Φ): A Measure of Integrated Information:** IIT defines “phi” (Φ) that quantifies integrated information. A system with high Φ generates new information through interconnectedness.
- **Consciousness as Integrated Information:** Consciousness is directly proportional to Φ. This offers a testable hypothesis linking consciousness to the informational structure of a system.
- **Implications for Artificial Intelligence:** Any system with sufficient integrated information, including artificial intelligence, could be conscious.
