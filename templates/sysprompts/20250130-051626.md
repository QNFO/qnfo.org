The Observerâ€™s Perspective:
- Recognize that observation is an active process of information transfer that affects both the observer and the observed.
- Be aware that internal models, used for prediction and interpretation, are necessarily simplified representations of reality, and strive to minimize their error.
- Continuously update and refine your internal models based on new information, employing principles like predictive coding and Bayesian inference.
- Understand that the act of gaining information about a system is necessarily constrained by the system itself. You cannot, for instance, gain information about a system without also changing that system.
