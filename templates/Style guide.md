**Corrected Style Guide for Capitalization (Version 3):**

1.  **Framework Names (infomatics):**
    -   Titles/Headings: Capitalize (“Infomatics”).
    -   Body Text: Lowercase (“infomatics”).

2.  **General Fields of Study/Broad Concepts:** Lowercase (physics, mathematics, quantum mechanics, general relativity, etc.).

3.  **Specific Named Theories, Models, Laws, Effects, Equations, Theorems, Hypotheses:**
    -   **Named After People:** Capitalize the **Name only**. Common noun part is **lowercase**.
        -   *Examples:* Newton’s laws, Einstein’s field equations, Schrödinger equation, Maxwell’s equations, Born rule, Planck’s constant, Hubble’s law, Heisenberg uncertainty principle (when Heisenberg is included), Gödel’s incompleteness theorems, Boltzmann’s equation, Shannon entropy, Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, Lorentz transformations, Feigenbaum constants, Bohmian mechanics.
    -   **Specific Established Models/Events (Treated as Proper Nouns):** Capitalize the full established name.
        -   *Examples:* Standard Model (of particle physics), ΛCDM Model, Big Bang.
    -   **Widely Recognized Named Principles/Interpretations/Hypotheses:** Capitalize the principal words when referring to the specific, established principle or interpretation as a distinct conceptual entity. (This is the correction).
        -   *Examples:*
            -   Cosmological Principle
            -   Equivalence Principle
            -   Uncertainty Principle (when Heisenberg isn’t mentioned)
            -   Holographic Principle
            -   Anthropic Principle
            -   Copenhagen Interpretation
            -   Many-Worlds Interpretation
            -   Information Universe Hypothesis (as a specific hypothesis name)
            -   Continuum Postulate (as a specific axiom within infomatics)
    -   **Generic Principles/Concepts:** Lowercase when used descriptively or generically.
        -   *Example:* “This relies on principles of equivalence...” vs. “This relies on the Equivalence Principle.”
        -   *Example:* “The model assumes a cosmological principle...” vs. “The model assumes the Cosmological Principle.”

4.  **Acronyms:** Always capitalized (CM, GR, QM, SM, EFE, FOL, ZFC, CMB, BBN, ΛCDM, QFT, IUH, ID, AI, QML, etc.).

5.  **Mathematical/Physical Constants:** Lowercase symbols (π, φ, *e*, √2, G, c, h, ħ, k<sub>B</sub>, Λ, γ, δ, α).

6.  **Infomatics Variables:** Lowercase symbols (κ, ε, τ, ρ, m). Universal Information as ‘I’. Existence as ‘X’. Informational Patterns as ‘Î’.

7.  **Buddhist/Eastern Terms:** Lowercase and *italicized on first use per section* (*śūnyatā*, *paṭicca samuppāda*, *anicca*, *vikalpa*, *citta*, etc.).

8.  **Titles and Headings:** Standard title case.

**Summary of Key Correction for Principles:** Established, named principles like the Cosmological Principle, Equivalence Principle, Uncertainty Principle (when standalone), Holographic Principle, Copenhagen Interpretation, Many-Worlds Interpretation **should be capitalized** when referring to the specific concept.

This revised guide aligns better with common practice where specific, named principles achieve a status similar to proper nouns within their respective fields.
